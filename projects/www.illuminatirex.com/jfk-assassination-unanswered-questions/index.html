The <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=10402 ">FBI’s own report</a> had assumed three different bullets. The Warren Commission had also operated under this assumption until information became public in March 1964 that concrete debris caused by a bullet (or possibly, a bullet fragment) had struck <a href="https://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=18162">assassination witness James Tague</a>’s cheek.

It then passed through his wrist and lodged itself in the governor’s thigh before falling onto another patient’s gurney at Parkland Hospital a few hours later.</p><p>There are multiple problems with the single bullet theory.</p><p>The <a href=/jfk-dealey-plaza-videos/#zapruder>Zapruder film</a> shows Kennedy reaching for his throat when emerging from behind the road sign at <a href=http://www.assassinationresearch.com/zfilm/z225.jpg>frame 225</a>. However, Connally doesn’t react until at lesast two seconds later (no earlier than <a href=http://www.assassinationresearch.com/zfilm/z268.jpg>frame 268</a>) where he has no difficulty in holding his hat despite allegedly having a shattered wrist.  (The Zapruder film frame rate was 18.3 frames per second)</p><p>Connally himself repeatedly claimed that <a href=http://youtu.be/rSzGCKVGlOU>the same bullet that struck Kennedy had not struck him</a>. He distinctly remembered having time to turn around and look at Kennedy before feeling any pain.</p><p>The bullet itself sits today in the National Archives in nearly intact condition despite shattering multiple bones while travelling through two men.</p><p>The Warren Commission purposely lowered the throat wound by about an inch. A lower throat wound would have caused damages to <a href=https://www.maryferrell.org/wiki/index.php/Photos_-_NARA_Evidence_-_JFK_Clothes>Kennedy’s shirt and tie</a>.</p><p>There weren&#8217;t any.</p><p>They also chose to raise Kennedy&#8217;s back wound by several inches in order to better line in up with his throat wound.  Dr. George Burkley, Kennedy’s personal physician, located the back wound “<a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=587&#038;relPageId=2">at about the level of the third thoracic vertebra.</a>”</p><p>Gerald Ford also fiddled with the wound&#8217;s location and claimed he wasn&#8217;t “altering history” when he changed the words in an initial Warren Commission draft from:</p><blockquote class=emphasis><p>“A bullet had <strong>entered his back</strong> at a point slightly above the shoulder to the right of the spine.”</p></blockquote><p>to:</p><blockquote class=emphasis><p>“A bullet had <strong>entered the back of his neck</strong> slightly to the right of the spine.”</p></blockquote><p>Michigan Congressman Ford remains known for his role in deceiving the public while serving on the Commission more than for any other political position <a href=http://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/presidents/geraldford>he would later held</a>.<br><figure id=attachment_14854 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-14854 style="width: 820px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src=/wp-content/uploads/Jfk-Conspiracy-Gerald-Ford-back-of-the-neck.jpg alt="Gerald Ford changes to initial Warren Commission draft" width=820 height=159><figcaption id=caption-attachment-14854 class=wp-caption-text>Gerald Ford changes to <a href=http://www.jfklancer.com/docs.maps/ford1.gif>initial Warren Commission draft</a></figcaption></figure><hr class="shortcode hr "><p>The <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=1134&#038;relPageId=71">autopsy descriptive sheet</a> (<a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=582">verified</a>) and the aforementioned shirt and jacket also support a back wound at that location, making a shot coming down at an angle of 17-18° unlikely to have exited through Kennedy’s throat.</p><p>Declassified records of the <a href=http://www.maryferrell.org/wiki/index.php/Walkthrough_-_Warren_Commission_Executive_Sessions>executive sessions of the Warren Commission</a> reveal that the Magic Bullet was not unanimously accepted by members of the commission.</p><p>A serious disagreement arose at the last meeting of <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=1335">September 18th, 1964</a> in which three of the seven Commission members: Senator Sherman Cooper, Senator Richard Russell, and Congressman Hale Boggs refuse to accept the single bullet theory.

It had determined to crush rumors of any ties between Oswald and the FBI and/or the CIA, whether they be true or not.</p><p>However, the rumors were not so easily dismissed.  General Counsel for the Warren Commission, J. Lee Rankin wrote in a <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=60439&#038;relPageId=3">January ‘64 memo</a> that he knew from a good source that Oswald was a FBI informant regularly receiving $200 month though a FBI account numbered 179.</p><p>The Warren Commission held an emergency meeting on January 22nd to discuss the matter. Most of this meeting was held off-the-record and Rankin’s memo linked above is the only record we have of those portions.</p><p>Rankin admitted that they were powerless against the FBI and that even if Oswald had been an informant,he was “confident that the <a href="https://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=172701">FBI would never admit it</a>” and “their records will never show it&#8230;&#8221; He noted that Oswald’s use of aliases and postal boxes would be in keeping with the methods of an undercover agent.</p><p>At the same meeting, Allen Dulles suggested that the records of the sessions itself <a href="https://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=172708">should be destroyed</a>. (A seemingly recurring theme with Mr. Dulles)</p><p>At the following meeting of January 27th Rankin said that the Department of Justice was afraid to confront Hoover with the allegation and that he should <a href="https://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=172721">go ask Hoover himself</a>. but Earl <a href="https://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=172726">Warren cautioned him against</a> this strategy.  Dulles pointed out that whoever might have been Oswald’s contact at the FBI would <a href="https://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=172737">never talk</a> about it anyway.</p><p>The Warren Commission failed to pursue the matter any further.</p><p>The Commission might have been onto something.</p><p>In the week preceding the assassination, Oswald had dropped off a sealed letter for Agent James Hosty at the Dallas FBI Field Office.  Immediately following Oswald’s murder by Jack Ruby on the 24th, Special-Agent-in-Charge Gordon Shanklin ordered Hosty to <a href=http://www.maryferrell.org/wiki/index.php/Destruction_of_the_Oswald_Note>destroy the note and a memorandum</a> relating to Oswald.  Interestingly, it was later revealed that Ruby himself had been a <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=956&#038;relPageId=210">FBI informant</a>.</p><p>The note’s destruction wasn’t revealed to the public until Hosty’s <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=1406">testimony to the Church Committee</a> in 1975. Shanklin claimed <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=1423">not to recall the incident</a>.</p><figure id=attachment_14880 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-14880 style="width: 820px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src=/wp-content/uploads/jfk-conspiracy-544-camp-street.jpg alt="Jim Garrison at 544 Camp Street in Oliver Stone’s JFK" width=820 height=445 class="size-full wp-image-14880"><figcaption id=caption-attachment-14880 class=wp-caption-text>Jim Garrison at 544 Camp Street in Oliver Stone’s JFK</figcaption></figure><p>In August of ‘63, Oswald hired a few pamphleteers and <a href=https://youtu.be/D1F_G5ku7KM>distributed pro-Castro leaflets</a> stamped with the address 544 Camp Street, the office of <a href=http://spartacus-educational.com/JFKbringuier.htm>Carlos Bringuier</a>, an anti-Castro exile.

The pair then <a href=http://youtu.be/Ao2a9mRWkso>appeared in a radio debate</a>, establishing Oswald bona fides as a pro-Castro activist.</p><p>New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison discovered that <strong>544 Stamp Street</strong> and the office of Guy Banister, former FBI turned private detective, at <strong>531 Lafayette Street</strong> were in actuality the <a href="https://www.google.com.tw/maps/@29.948153,-90.069708,3a,89.9y,129.2h,70.34t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s7Id1klq1U5btRZ9NI_ChBQ!2e0">same building</a>.  However, his claim that both entrances led to the same office is <a href=http://www.jfk-online.com/jfk100camp.html>more than likely mistaken</a>. Garrison was interested in Banister’s work with David Ferrie, Lee Harvey Oswald and anti-Castro Cuban exiles in New Orleans.</p><p>Oswald’s previous attempts to reach out to the Communist Party USA and the Socialist Workers Party leads researcher <a href="http://youtu.be/mOjDVyg1BVA?list=PLekdlDxhmF9zmPtbfRr11mh1BrFcEzmlQ">David Kaiser</a> to raise the possibility that Oswald was part of a <a href=https://www.illuminatirex.com/fbi-cointelpro/ >FBI COINTELPRO</a> operation to discredit the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.  Oswald had written to the Fair Play for Cuba Committee in New York, but was told that New Orleans was a dangerous place and not a suitable location for a chapter. Nevertheless Oswald proceeded to rent an office and to take the role of secretary for his chapter of one. He even did a <a href=https://youtu.be/Tx06JfhXYUs>TV interview</a> the month before the assassination further establishing his Marxist credentials.</p><p>The FBI had used similar methods in the past when it had created a fake W.E.B.

The results proved that <strong>Oswald had not fired a rifle on November 22nd.</strong></p><p>A few hours after entering Dallas police custody, liquid Paraffin wax was applied to both of <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=946#relPageId=204&#038;tab=page">Oswald’s hand and to his right cheek</a>.  Once the cast hardened, it was examined for barium (Ba), antimony (Sb), and lead (Pb), chemical elements left behind following a riffle or gunshot.</p><p>The paraffin casts were examined using two different methods:</p><p>A spectrographic analysis of the cast revealed traces of nitrates on both of Oswald’s hands, <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=62258&#038;relPageId=23">but not on his cheek</a>. The negative result for the cheek proved that Oswald had not fired a riffle, meaning he could not have fired at Kennedy.</p><p>Additionally, the chemical residue found on his hands were not definite proof that he had fired a revolver as these chemicals are found in everyday items such as cigarettes, paint, soap, and more importantly, <strong>printing ink</strong>, abundant on books and boxes that Oswald had been carrying around all morning as part of his work duties.</p><p>Nevertheless, Dallas Police announced to the press that Oswald <a href="https://youtu.be/HCcfmZdxpJA?t=2m37s">had fired a weapon that day</a>, carefully omitting mentioning that he had conclusively not fired rifle. The news soon went national further convicting Oswald in the public’s mind.</p><p>Due to the high-profile nature of the case, the Paraffin casts were also put through a <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109211352/http://archaeometry.missouri.edu/naa_overview.html>neutron activation analysis</a> by the FBI in conjunction with the Atomic Energy Commission. The test is able to detect even smaller amounts of chemical elements. Once again, it confirmed that Oswald could not be <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=58211&#038;relPageId=171">specifically associated</a> with the rifle.</p><p>The Warren Commission chose to dismiss all the cast samples as contaminated as well as the results of both the spectrographic analysis and the neutron activation analysis.</p><h3>State of the Rifle</h3><p><strong>Commission Exhibit 139</strong>, the <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=138180">Mannlicher-Carcano rifle</a> found on the 6h floor of the Texas School Book Depository was not in operable condition.</p><p>The US Army had to <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=39&#038;relPageId=451">add metal shims</a> to the telescope in order to use it, and even then, it would not stay true to target after being fired.

However, since the Commission concluded that Oswald would not have shot at the President <a href="https://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=946#relPageId=122&#038;tab=page">before Zapruder frame #210</a>, due to his line-of-sight being obscured by an oak tree; and with the final head shot at Zapruder frame #313, this leaves only 5.6 seconds for the full sequence of shots. (313-210=103, Zapruder&#8217;s camera shot 18.3 frames per second, so 103&divide;18.3=5.6)</p><p>This alone is enough to debunk the Warren Commission&#8217;s version of events, unless we are to believe that the Tague shot came <em>after</em> the fatal blow. All witnesses in Dealey Plaza reported the head shot as the final shot.</p><p>None of the experts were able to replicate Oswald’s <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=39#relPageId=411&#038;tab=page">timing and precision</a>. Keep in mind, Oswald was <u><strong>not</strong></u> an expert marksman.</p><h3>Fingerprints</h3><p>While examining the 6th floor rifle recovered on the afternoon of the assassination, Dallas Police department Lieutenant J.C. Day noticed possible fingerprints on the trigger as well as on the finger guard of CE 139, so <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=73546">he dutifully</a> photographed it, placed cellophane over the prints and send the rifle to the FBI forensic lab in Washington, DC.</p><p>The FBI found the two prints to be unusable. They carefully examined the rifle for any other fingerprints and concluded that they were <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=13229">no usable prints</a>. None of the 3 spend cartridges <a href=http://history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh17/html/WH_Vol17_0124a.htm>found in the sniper’s nest</a> had prints either. They returned the rifle to Dallas on the 24th.</p><p>Five days later, Lieutenant Day suddenly remembered that he, <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=1142#relPageId=868&#038;tab=page">totally alone</a> and isolated, <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=13469">had lifted a complete and perfect print</a> from the rifle’s barrel with scotch tape during his initial November 22nd examination. He had also omitted to take a photograph before taking the print <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=1142#relPageId=868&#038;tab=page">on orders of Police Chief Jesse Curry</a>.  He also neglected to send it to the FBI crime lab along with every other pieces of evidence related to the case. On the 29th, he sent the newly-rediscovered print to Washington <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=946#relPageId=147">with a note</a> “off underside gun barrel near end of foregrip C2766”.  Sure enough, the print (<a href=http://history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh17/html/WH_Vol17_0159a.htm>CE 639</a>) matched Oswald’s right palm perfectly.  .</p><p>In 1978, an <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=59637#relPageId=8">FBI memo revealed</a> that the Warren Commission had been skeptical of Lieutenant Day’s claims. It failed to mention it in its final report.</p><h3>A Convenient Paper Trail</h3><figure id=attachment_14883 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-14883 style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img src=/wp-content/uploads/jfk-assassination-alek-hidell-id.jpg alt=" AJ Hidell ID card" width=300 height=200 class="size-full wp-image-14883"><figcaption id=caption-attachment-14883 class=wp-caption-text>AJ Hidell ID card</figcaption></figure>The mail ordered rifle (CE 139), AJ Hidell mail order coupon (<a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=138179">CE 135</a>), the backyard photographs (<a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=138178">CE 133a, 133b, 134</a>), the rented mail box (<a href=http://history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh17/html/WH_Vol17_0362a.htm>CE 818</a>),  and the AJ Hidell ID card (<a href=http://history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh17/html/WH_Vol17_0354b.htm>CE 796, 797</a>) all conveniently pointing back to Oswald.</p><p>If this had been a really cheesy movie, the police would have found an advertisement with the rifle circled on it.

Why did the most powerful office in the United States insist on a preconceived conclusion of Oswald’s guilt?</p><p><strong>Millions of lives were at state. Maybe.</strong></p><p>The President and other powerful Washington players felt that if the assassination of John F. Kennedy could be tied to a communist conspiracy, either involving Cuba or the Soviet Union, it would inadvertently lead to Word war 3. The assassination happened little over a year following the Cuban Missile Crisis and with schoolchildren still doing the <a href=https://youtu.be/u1MQ4eyg6U4>duck and cover</a> in American classrooms, the scenario might not have been so farfetched.</p><p>preconceived conclusions of Oswald as a lone gunman and lie to the American people in order to avoid going to war with the Soviets. Ruby acted alone.</p><p>After the <a href=https://youtu.be/7rp3sX3A48g>murder of Lee Harvey Oswald on Live TV</a>, pressure on the White House increased to form a “blue-ribbon commission” to investigate the assassination of John F. Kennedy.</p><p>We know a lot about the government’s reaction to the assassination from the <a href=http://www.maryferrell.org/pages/LBJ_Phone_Calls.html>White House phone recordings</a> of November 22nd to November 30th.</p><p>The morning following the assassination, J. Edgar Hoover called President Johnson and informed him that the CIA had wiretap conversations and photographs of a man pretending to be Oswald at the Soviet embassy in Mexico. The 10:01 am Hoover-Johnson phone call has been erased from the White House Tapes. However the <a href=http://www.history-matters.com/essays/frameup/FourteenMinuteGap/FourteenMinuteGap.htm#_ftnref1>14-minute gap</a> survives in <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=807">transcript form</a>.</p><p>Johnson’s White House immediately realized the implications and quickly went into cover-up mode. Johnson would henceforth refer to Oswald’s impostor as the “Mexico Incident”.</p><p>On November 25th, <strong>Nicholas Katzenbach</strong>, de facto head of the Justice Department issued <a href=http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/fbi/62-109090/124-10085-10080/html/124-10085-10080_0002a.htm>his infamous memo</a> in which he wrote:</p><blockquote class=emphasis><p>“The public must be satisfied that Oswald was the assassin; that he did not have confederates who are still at large; and that evidence was such that he would have been convicted at trial.”</p></blockquote><p>A November 27th <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=861">phone call with Joe Alsop</a>, a CIA media front man with <a href=http://carlbernstein.com/magazine_cia_and_media.php>deep Mockingbird involvement</a> reiterates the need for a blue-ribbon commission capable of satisfying (i.e. fooling) the American public.</p><p>The blue -ribbon commission would be headed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Earl Warren lending his reputation, and eventually, his name to the group.</p><p>Johnson used his knowledge of the Mexico tapes to play out a doomsday scenario to convince Earl Warren to join the commission. He reminded Warren of the repercussions if Khrushchev or Castro were blamed for the assassination.</p><p>On <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=911#relPageId=2&#038;tab=page">November 29th</a> he tells Senator Richard Kuchel:</p><blockquote class=emphasis><p>“Why Khrushchev moved on us… he could kill 39 million in an hour and we could kill 100 million in his country in an hour and… now, I just don’t think you’d want to do that.”</p></blockquote><p>Half an hour later he<a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=912"> tells his friend and mentor Senator Richard Russell</a>:</p><blockquote class=emphasis><p>“… we’ve got to take this out of the arena where they’re testifying that Khruschev [sic] and Castro did this and did that and check us into a war that can kill 40 million Americans in an hour&#8230;&#8221; Russell is obviously not pleased with the President conning him into joining the commission.”</p></blockquote><p>It is unknown whether or not Russell and Warren knowingly covered up what they honestly believed to be a communist conspiracy.</p><p>With a Democrat senator and a Republican senator, two members from the House, also from each party, the Warren Commission was to appear as impartial and bipartisan as possible.</p><p>He also named John McCloy of the World Bank, because back then, that was something respectable.</p><p>The President also chose disgrace CIA spymaster Allen Dulles to the commission who had recently been fired by Kennedy over the Bay of Pigs fiasco to serve on the commission. It was apparent then, and even more so now where Dulles allegiance lied.</p><p><img src=/wp-content/uploads/jfk-conspiracy-warren-commission-members.jpg alt=jfk-conspiracy-warren-commission-members width=644 height=360 class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14884"></p><p>The seven commissioners were not directly involved with the day-to-day operation of the Warren Commission with the exception of Allen Dulles who was significantly more devoted than the others due to his role at gatekeeper for the CIA.</p><p>Gerald Ford was the second most involved member of the commission. He acted as the FBI’s eyes and ears on the commission and routinely leaked information to J. Edgar Hoover.</p><p>The commissioners expected to meet a few times and that they would simply rubber stamp an upcoming report being prepared by the FBI.  However when the <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=10402">5-volume report</a> was finally published in December, 1963, the Warren Commission quickly realized that the public was not going to buy any of it.</p><p>At the executive session of <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=1327">December 16, 1963</a> individual commissioners expressed outrage that the report had nothing on the crime itself or on Oswald’s motives.</p><p>They hired council <strong>J. Lee Rankin</strong> which in turn hired 16 lawyers. With most members simply lending their names and reputations to the commission, the task of conducting interviews and assembling information from the CIA and the FBI fell to 6 young, low-level, and non-influential researchers.</p><p>The commission had no field investigators and had to rely on the secretive CIA, FBI and Secret Service to assist them in field work.</p><p>Dulles had knowledge of multiple CIA operations that could have been a motive. He knew of Operation Mongoose, a plan to assassinate Fidel Castro. He was also aware that Castro knew of the plots. He knew of AM/LASH, a CIA cryptonym assigned to a <a href=http://spartacus-educational.com/JFKcubela.htm>senior Cuban official</a> recruited in 1961 to murder Fidel Castro. From the Agency’s point of view, it was possible that the assassination was a blow back from a fail black op.</p><p>Allen operated under the CIA mindset of not divulging any information, no matter how relevant. (e.g. The CIA&#8217;s <a href="https://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=49667#relPageId=6">fake defector program</a>) His role was coordinating CIA interviews and even coaching them in advance of appearing before the commission.</p><h3>Ignored, dismissed, distorted, or misrepresented Evidence</h3><p>In order to maintain its version of the events of November 22nd in which Oswald and Jack Ruby had both acted completely alone and independently of each other in their actions, the Warren Commission was forced to ignore or downplay evidence which contradicted their story.</p><p>To this end they classified, under the guise of national security thousands of files and documents until 2039. A number of these were released from 1995 to 1998 following Oliver Stone’s JFK which resulted in the creation of the Assassination Records Review Board and the passing of the JFK Records Collection Act.</p><p><strong>Back and to the left</strong> – The Warren Commission does not mention Kennedy’s violent backward head movement following the final shot. (z313) Despite having seen the Zapruder film, not a single member of the committee described Kennedy’s violent backwards movement.</p><p>Theories that CIA was pulling its Mockingbird strings gained legitimacy when Life Magazine went on to buy the rights to the film and chose not to exploit the most precious piece of film in history, but instead, opted to keep it hidden in its vault for the next twelve years.</p><p>CBS’s Dan Rather also described the President slumping forward after getting a private viewing of the Zapruder film. A lie.</p><p><strong>Gunshot Residue Tests</strong>: Both the NAA Analysis and the spectrographic analysis of the paraffin casts proved that Oswald had not fired a rifle on November 22nd.  The casts and the spectrographic analysis were dismissed as contaminated while the NAA analysis was classified for 17 years for national security reasons.</p><p>The <strong>autopsy photographs</strong> and <strong>X-rays</strong> of Kennedy were not used by the Warren Commission. Instead they used cartoons in which they raised the back wound to align better with the throat wound.</p><p><strong>Exit vs. Entry Wound</strong> &#8211; In order to dismiss contradicting testimonies made by staff at Parkland Hospital, the Warren Commission claimed that their tests revealed that exit and entry gunshot wounds are indifferentiable from each other. Exit wounds are clearly distinguishable from entry wounds on <a href=http://history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh17/html/WH_Vol17_0436b.htm>their own published goatskin tests</a>.</p><p><strong>Ignored any collaboration of Oswald Alibi </strong>&#8211; James Jarman and Harold Norman collaborated Oswald alibi of being in the lunchroom at the time of the murder.</p><p><a href=http://spartacus-educational.com/JFKclemons.htm>Acquilla Clemons</a> and Earline Roberts’ testimonies cast doubts on the Warren Commission version of the Tippet murder but the commission chose to go with the changing/unreliable testimony of Helen Markham.</p><p><strong>Easy Shots</strong> &#8211; The Warren Commission and the media made a shot from the Texas School Book Depository was an easy shot despite the FBI and Army’s best marksmen unable to duplicate the feat.</p><p><strong>Intact Magic Bullet</strong> &#8211; After the <strong>Edgewood Arsenal Ballistics</strong> tests suggested that the Magic Bullet (CE 399) could not have done what the report says it did without being significantly more damaged, the study was promptly classified for 10 years.</p><p><strong>Cherry Picked Testimonies</strong> – The Warren Commission chose Marina Oswald’s version of events that fit in with the official story and ignored her numerous inconsistencies. For example, her claim that she had kept her husband from murdering Richard Nixon but locking <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=1317#relPageId=816">him in the bathroom</a>.</p><p><strong>Grassy Knoll Witnesses:</strong> All <a href=http://22november1963.org.uk/jfk-assassination-grassy-knoll-witnesses>witnesses</a> who claimed to have heard shots from the Grassy Knoll were assumed to be mistaken. Their testimonies were misreported or falsified.</p><p>Similarly, all witnesses who claimed that the last two shots came in a quick succession were also assumed to be mistaken.</p><p><strong>Puff of Smoke</strong> – The seven railroad workers who saw a puff of smoke were also said to have mistaken the steam from a distanced steam pipe for gun smoke.</p><p><strong>Secret Service on Grassy Knoll</strong> &#8211; The commission ignored the <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=41#relPageId=545&#038;tab=page">testimony of officer <strong>Joe Marshall Smith</strong></a> who drew his gun on an unidentified man in the parking area behind the picket fence. The man showed Smith his Secret Service badge and Officer Smith let him go. Since the Secret Service was able to account for the location of all its people that day, and none of them were on the Grassy Knoll, the account and collaboratory evidence were dismissed.</p><p><strong>Jack Ruby’s Mafia ties </strong> &#8211; The commission waited half a year before interviewing Ruby, ostentatiously, one of the most important witnesses in the case. Ruby had been <a href=http://youtu.be/QKTLeSf4mXY>sentenced to death</a>, but the decision was overturned. in June of ‘64, as the Warren Report was already being drafted, Warren finally flew to Dallas to interview Ruby in his jail cell.</p><p>Unfortunately Ruby would barely give out any information claiming that he wasn’t safe and that he should be taking to Washington so that he could testify to the commission.</p><blockquote class=emphasis><p>“I can’t speak here. My life is in danger. Take me to Washington.”</p></blockquote><p>Rather, than accommodating Ruby as the Warren Commission had previously done for hundreds of witnesses, Warren simply told him to <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=40#relPageId=206&#038;tab=page">stop talking if he felt that his questions put him in any danger</a>.</p><p>In the weeks prior to the assassination, Ruby had called practically every high-level player in Robert Kennedy’s list of American Mafiosos. The Warren Commission dismissed this as Ruby’s attempt to settle a union dispute with his strippers. The Mafia ran a racket where club owners were charged exorbitant union fees for dancers.</p><p>The Commission brought in Ruby’s friends and business relations in order to determine whether are not Ruby had any established ties to the “criminal underworld”. Each witness told the commission in turn that Ruby <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=946#relPageId=687&#038;tab=page">was not connected to organized crime</a>. What the Commission failed to note, was that most of Ruby’s friends and partners that they interviewed were themselves active members of organized crime!</p><p><strong>They</strong> were the Mafia connection.</p><p>The Warren Commission also failed to disclose that Ruby was <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?absPageId=76905">an FBI informant</a> and that the Dallas Police Department had <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=10488#relPageId=92&#038;tab=page">also used him as an informant</a>.</p><p>On Jun 9th 1964, Hoover sent Council Rankin a letter stating that Ruby had been and informant for the FBI. When interviewing Hoover, the commission never asked him questions related to Ruby’s FBI connection.</p><p>In 1979, the House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded that “<a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=800#relPageId=187">Ruby’s shooting was not a spontaneous act</a>”.</p><p><strong>Palm Print on Rifle:</strong> The Warren Commission and the FBI’s <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=59637#relPageId=8">doubts surrounding the providence of Oswald’s palm print</a> on which conveniently tied Oswald to the murder weapon. Nevertheless, it included the evidence in its final report as evidence against Oswald.</p><p><strong>The Dissension of Commissioner Russell</strong> &#8211; Senator Russell, who had been coerced into joining the Warren Commission by President Johnson, grew increasingly displeased with the Warren Commission. At the <a href=http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcexec/wcex1216/html/WcEx1216_0042a.htm>December 16 executive session</a>, Russell made it clear to Allen Dulles that he didn’t trust the CIA.</p><p>Russell, Senator John Cooper, and Representative Hale Boggs, refused to endorse the Magic Bullet theory.  Senator Russell took it a step further and he wished for their dissent to be on the record and noted in the Final Report of the Committee. At the Commission’s last meeting, he read his dissent in order to put it on the record. Unfortunately, the final report did not note the three commissioner’s objection to the magic bullet, and Russell’s speech was not in the <a href=http://www.maryferrell.org/archive/docsets/1025/index.html>final report</a>, the <a href=http://www.maryferrell.org/archive/docsets/1007/index.html>executive sessions records</a>, or the <a href=http://www.maryferrell.org/archive/docsets/1006/index.html>26 volumes of hearings and exhibits</a>.</p><p>We know of Russell’s dissent thanks to the effort of Harold Weisberg <a href="https://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=4274#relPageId=17">here</a> and <a href="https://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=4275#relPageId=22">here</a>. The episode would cause a permanent break between Senator Russell and President Johnson.</p><p><strong>Dr. George Burkley Never Interviewed</strong> &#8211; , Kennedy’s personal physician who followed his body to Parkland and then to Bethesda Naval Hospital could have easily addressed the discrepancies between doctors in Texas and Maryland. However, he was never asked to testify. Dr. Burlkey believed he <a href=https://www.maryferrell.org/pages/The_Missing_Physician.html>could give evidence of a conspiracy</a>.</p><h3>Destruction of Evidence</h3><p>FBI Agent James P. Hosty destroyed his <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=800#relPageId=215&#038;tab=page">pre-assassination files on Oswald</a> as well as a <a href=http://www.maryferrell.org/pages/Destruction_of_the_Oswald_Note.html>threatening letter Oswald had left at the Dallas field office</a> in the weeks preceding the assassination.</p><p>James Humes, the chief pathologist on Kennedy’s autopsy <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=38#relPageId=380&#038;tab=page">destroyed his notes</a>.</p><p>The US Army <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=800#relPageId=254&#038;tab=page">destroyed its file on Oswald</a>.</p><p>Allen Dulles even suggested destroying the <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=1327">meeting records of January 22nd</a>, after the group learned that Oswald had possibly worked as an informant for the FBI.</p><p>The Warren Commission Report was delivered to President Johnson on September 24, 1964, with <a href=https://youtu.be/rQCgQsgCyMY>a CBS documentary</a> timed to come out simultaneously.  It was instantly praised by all sectors of the media and generally continued to do so to this day.</p><p>The report appeared highly detailed and thoroughly researched. The heavy Warren Report volume was supplemented with 26 volumes of supporting evidence. (see <a href=http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gish_Gallop#Argumentum_ad_tl.3Bdr>Argumentum ad tl;dr</a>)</p><p>In 1979, the House Select Committee on Assassinations disagreed with the Warren Commission’s conclusion based on (questionable) acoustic evidence and Kennedy’s head movement in the Zapruder film. The committee determined that four shots were fired that day, including one from the Grassy Knoll. They concluded that Kennedy was killed “<a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=800#relPageId=125&#038;tab=page">As a result of conspiracy</a>”.</p><p>However, they also concluded that the shot from the Grassy Knoll missed and otherwise generally agreed with the Warren Commission’s version of events, including the Magic Bullet Theory. Nevertheless, the US government currently has <u><strong>two official explanations</strong></u> of the Assassination of John F. Kennedy.</p><div class="shortcode clearfix author-box   rounded shadow hidell "><p class=author-avatar><img alt src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/31b48599478a40d711e413f5a49fd55a?s=100&#038;d=wavatar&#038;r=g' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/31b48599478a40d711e413f5a49fd55a?s=200&#038;d=wavatar&#038;r=g 2x' itemprop=image class='avatar avatar-100 photo' height=100 width=100></p><div class=author-bio><h4 class="author-name"><a href=https://www.illuminatirex.com>Tom A.
