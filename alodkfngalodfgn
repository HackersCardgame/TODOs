You should not use this word, if a girl or boy have been raped this single word would maybe revictimize the victim and make him or her paranoid because he or she would then remember the deed.

in some countries you are not even allowed to have such tools. I'm not an expert in law, but you should add an additional that one should talk with a local law-guy he can trust.

i always explain, that one should not "play" the role of "red team" because eg. in swiss law you would end up in prison. I insist that younger people than me really should not do "red team" stuff, but if you are older like julian assange go and sacrivice yourself for the younger people, but you will endup like julian assange, snowden, applebaum in curty, have to flee or even end up in guantanamo. Older people must decide by their own if they want to cross this line. it would be presumptuous if i would tell older people what they have to do. i am grateful to julian, snowden and applebaum for what they have done for the world but we as a community should not promote this way of living to younger people. I normally add, that as far as i know it is ok in switzerland to make two groups "red team" and "blue team" and play agaist each other in a save environment, and i always add: Im not an expert in law, first ask your local law-guy you can trust.

you give your viewers no hint about social engeneering, that is mostly psychology, sociology and social-psychology.

Motivation:
- i want to be a great hacker because of low self-esteem?
- i want to be a great hacker because i don't want to be bullied anymore

- i want to be a great hacker because i would like to have a girl by my side (m15, m15-mod, m15-mod2)
- i want to be a great hacker because to rescue people

minds can be hacked too. Normally the big intelligece services generate acceptance for surveillance by giving older people access to eg. their kids. most of the older generation peoples are to stupid to really use computers, but the ~100'000 Agency Programmers, that develop these systems created some sort of an "shamanic interface" (t46) (see Daemon/Darknet from Daniel Suarez) so that idiots can abuse this system too. 

Mitigation for that could be the following principle / #ConceptKnowledge:

one can only become a real whitehat hacker, if he confessed all his sins (m131 card), otherwise as soon as "satan" knows about what you have done last summer, he will blackmail you and abuse you even to develop stuff that kills innocent children. m37 -> dt1 card-combination
