<h6>MKULTRA is a cryptonym assigned to a series of CIA behavior modification and mind control experiments.</h6>
</div> <!-- /shortcode box -->
<strong>Operation MKULTRA was an umbrella for a series of CIA experiments with drugs, hypnosis, sleep deprivation, sensory deprivation, electroshocks, and other forms of torture on uninformed Americans and Canadians in an effort to discover the ideal truth serum, manipulate memories, and modify behaviors.</strong></p>
<h2>Origin Of Mind Control</h2>
<figure id="attachment_17108" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17108" style="width: 170px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img src="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/Government-Conspiracy-CIA-MKULTRA-Malleus-maleficarum.jpg" alt="" width="170" height="241" class="size-full wp-image-17108" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17108" class="wp-caption-text">Maleus Mafeficarum</figcaption></figure>Those in power have always sought to manipulate and control the minds of their subjects as well as those of their enemies. <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Travels_of_Marco_Polo/Book_1/Chapter_23">Marco Polo popularized</a> the legend of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashid_ad-Din_Sinan">The Old Man of the Mountain</a> who used a potion (hashish) and mind tricks to create and train assassins desperate to obey their master and return to “Paradise”. </p>
<p>Late medieval Inquisitors authored the <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/mm/">Maleus Mafeficarum</a>, or ‘The Hammer for Sorceresses’ in which they codified methods for the interrogation of witches. The book became a bestseller, second only to the Bible. It was the de facto manual for obtaining confessions during the infamous witch trials. As <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/international/24MEMO-GUIDE.html?_r=0">in modern times</a>, the use of torture in interrogations was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_extirpanda">authorized at the highest level of the Church</a>. Holy Inquisitors were given Absolution (forgiveness) for their acts.</p>
<p>German physician Franz Mesmer stumbled unto the power of suggestions in the late 18th century with his development of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_magnetism">animal magnetism</a>.  Mesmer travelled throughout France curing aristocrats of their ailments, becoming a phenomenon and irritating the medical establishment. In 1784, King Louis XVI formed a commission made up of this same medical establishment to look into animal magnetism. Predictively, they concluded that there was no evidence for any of Mesmer’s claims. Disgraced, Mesmer left France and was soon (<a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mesmerize">almost</a>) forgotten. However, the commission also issued a second, secret <a href="https://www.rcpe.ac.uk/sites/default/files/files/the_royal_commission_on_animal_-_translated_by_iml_donaldson_1.pdf">‘King’s Eyes Only’ report</a>, warning Louis and his ministers of the dangers of hypnotic seduction.</p>

They would perform tricks similar to today&#8217;s stage hypnotists, such as the ‘<a href="https://youtu.be/hiYhMJoGung">human plank</a>’. It wouldn’t be long before government agencies took an interest in these techniques for their own purposes.</p>
<hr class="shortcode hr white" style="border-width:1px;" />
<h2>US Government Interest in Mind Control</h2>
<p>US interest in mind control can be traced back to the Second World War.  The OSS, the wartime intelligence agency preceding the CIA, formed the Truth Serum Committee, under the Manhattan Project umbrella, to find a drug to aid in interrogations.  George White, who would later become infamous for testing of LSD on unsuspecting citizens in New  York and San Francisco enters the behavior control picture and begins testing different strains of marijuana on himself as well as test subjects. </p>
<figure id="attachment_17110" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17110" style="width: 200px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img src="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/Government-Conspiracy-CIA-Nuremberg-Trials.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="175" class="size-full wp-image-17110" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17110" class="wp-caption-text">Nuremberg Trials</figcaption></figure>At the same time Nazi scientist Dr. Kurt Plötner experimented with mescaline on prisoners at Dachau to “eliminate the will of the person examined”, Dr. Winfred Overholser performed similar experiments on unwitting subject at St. Elizabeth Hospital in Washington, DC. Plötner was eventually recruited by US intelligence as part of <a href="http://www.illuminatirex.com/top-ten-government-conspiracies/#PAPERCLIP">Operation Paperclip</a>, a US intelligence program to protect Nazi war criminals from prosecution in return for aiding the United States against the Communists.</p>
<p>The US government played a major role at the Nuremberg Trials and in the formulation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Code">Nuremberg Code</a>, a set of ethics and principles for conducting human experimentations. Meanwhile,  its intelligence agencies ignored all ten points in its research. Medical doctors working for the CIA defied their oaths to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primum_non_nocere">do no harm</a>. To avoid public scrutiny, anything dodgy was labeled TOP SECRET, an abuse of National Security that continues to this day.</p>
<p>The Army Chemical Corps also began research into mind control. They tested potential drugs, such as <a href="https://youtu.be/zLCzR34HfVQ">LSD on American troops</a> and on unwitting US citizens, with tragic circumstances for pro tennis player, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Blauer">Harold Blauer</a>. Blauer died soon after checking  into the New York Psychiatric Institute seeking treatment for depression following a divorce. He was unaware that the institute had an agreement with the Army Chemical Corps to test drugs on patients as part of the Army’s mind control experiments. Blauer was given five heavy doses of a mescaline derivative (MDA), killing him. The incident led to a subsequent <a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/853/124/121222/">22-year cover-up</a> by the State of New York and the Army. In 1987, a Judge finally <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1987-05-06/news/mn-2486_1_chemical-warfare-agents">awarded $700k to Blauer’s estate</a>.</p>

That same year, the CIA was created. The new agency took over the OSS’ responsibilities, including its truth serum research.</p>
<p>The CIA was intrigued by the <a href="https://youtu.be/C4XDF2jQEGk">testimony of Roman Catholic Cardinal József Mindszenty</a> during his infamous show trial in Budapest where he confessed to having committed treason, despite not having done so. The Agency was convinced that the cardinal had been under hypnosis. Informants at the Secret Police Headquarters on Andrassy Street where Mindszenty was <a href="https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=10004">interrogated for 39 consecutive days</a> confirmed that the Soviets had used hypnotism and drugs.</p>

<h2>Project BLUEBIRD</h2>
<figure id="attachment_17084" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17084" style="width: 175px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img src="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/Government-Conspiracy-CIA-BLUEBIRD-authorization.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="246" class="size-full wp-image-17084" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17084" class="wp-caption-text">BLUEBIRD Authorization <br />

By the end of the 1940s, US intelligence agencies as well as individual divisions within the CIA were all conducting their own independent mind control experiments. On April 20th, 1950, the CIA <a href="http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/mkultra/MKULTRA1/DOC_0000144900/DOC_0000144900.pdf">launched Project BLUEBIRD</a> with former Naval Intelligence officer Morse Allen at its head in order to consolidate these programs and bring together the knowledge of interrogation techniques, truth serums, and hypnosis. </p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000140401.pdf">January 1952 document</a> outlined some of the questions facing BLUEBIRD researchers: <strong>(Note: H= Hypnosis; SI= Sleep Induction)</strong></p>
<blockquote class="emphasis"><p>“1. Can we “condition” by post-H suggestion agency employees) or persons of interest to this agency) to prevent them from giving information to any unauthorized source or for committing any act on behalf of a foreign or domestic enemy?</p>
<p>2. Can we in a matter of an hour, two hours, one day, etc., induce an H condition in an unwilling subject to such an extent that he will perform an act for our benefit? (Long range).</p>
<p>3. Can we create by post-H control an action contrary to an individual&#8217;s basic moral principles?</p>
<p>4. Could we seize a subject and in the space of an hour or two by post-H control have him crash an airplane, wreck a train, etc.? (Short, immediate activity)</p>
<p>5. Can we by H and SI techniques force a subject (unwilling or otherwise) to travel long distances, commit specified acts and return to us or bring documents or materials? Can a person acting under post-H control successfully travel long distances?</p>
<p>6.  Can we use SI and H to combat fatigue, produce extreme mental effort?</p>
<p>7.  Can we guarantee total amnesia under any and all conditions?</p>
<p>8.  Can we &#8220;alter&#8221; a person&#8217;s personality? How long will it hold?</p>
<p>9.  Can we design tests to determine whether or not an enemy agent has been conditioned by SI and H or any other method?</p>
<p>10.   Can we detect SI and H by use of SI and H (regression)?</p>
<p>11.   Can we make a &#8220;conditioned&#8221; subject reveal by SI and H specifically how they were conditioned (drugs, torture, fatigue, hostage pressure, techniques)?</p>
<p>12.   Can we devise a system for making unwilling subjects into willing agents and then transfer that control to untrained agency agents in the field by use of codes or identifying signs or credentials?</p>
<p>13.   How long can we sustain a post-H suggestion &#8211; unaided &#8211; with reinforcement?</p>
<p>14.   What would be fastest way to induce SI and H conditions &#8211; with drugs &#8211; or without any mechanical aids?</p>
<p>15.   Can we devise a standard, simple, relatively fast technique for inducing SI and H conditions that can be used by untrained agents (with or without drugs)?</p>
<p>16.   Is it possible to find a gas that can be used to gain SI control from a gas pencil, odorless, colorless: one shot, etc.?</p>
<p>17.   What are full details on &#8220;sleep-inducing machine&#8221;?</p>
<p>18.   How can sodium A or P or any other sleep inducing agent be best concealed in a normal or commonplace item, such as candy, cigarettes, liqueur, wines, coffee, tea, beer, gum water, aspirin tablets, common medicines, coke, tooth paste?</p>
<p>19.  How effective can the &#8220;carotid artery technique&#8221; be made? Can it be used while subject is unconscious? Is it faster than other techniques?</p>
<p>20.  Can we, using SI and H extract complicated formula from scientists, engineers, etc., if unwilling? Can we extract details of gun emplacements, landing fields, factories, mines?</p>
<p>21.  Can we, while a subject is under SI and H control, show them a map and have them point out specific items, locations, etc., on the map? Can we also have them make detailed drawings, sketches, plans?</p>
<p>Could any of the above be done under field conditions and in a very short space of time?”</p>

<p>During the early years, Allen and his team replicated known hypnosis experiments. By 1951, Agents <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000140393.pdf">received courses in hypnosis</a> for use in field operations. He also produced a now-lost film named <strong>The Black Art</strong> in which an American agent spikes the drink of an Asian target, causing him to fall asleep. The agent then programs the man using hypnosis. The film cuts to the next scene where the target is seen removing documents from a locked safe and delivering them to the awaiting agent.</p>
<p>The Agency formed elite teams to conduct interrogations and to <a href="https://archive.org/details/DOC_0000147390">protect against infiltration by enemies</a> employing similar methods. Special BLUEBIRD interrogation teams traveled to Japan to apply and test their methods on Korean prisoners of wars held there.</p>
<h2>Project ARTICHOKE</h2>
<p>On August 20, 1951, the CIA gave Project BLUEBIRD the <a href="http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/mkultra/MKULTRA2/DOC_0000190713/DOC_0000190713.pdf">new designation of Project ARTICHOKE</a>.  </p>
<figure id="attachment_17085" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17085" style="width: 170px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img src="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/Government-Conspiracy-CIA-brainwashing-in-red-china.jpg" alt="" width="170" height="241" class="size-full wp-image-17085" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17085" class="wp-caption-text">Brain-washing in Red China</figcaption></figure>Researchers turned their attentions to American prisoners of war held in Korea admitting on television to using biochemical weapons (including Anthrax) against Korea. They had succeeded earlier in the <a href="http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/mkultra/MKULTRA1/DOC_0000144729/DOC_0000144729.pdf">interrogation of Russian agents</a> using ARTICHOKE methods. Meanwhile, a CIA propagandist embedded as a journalist at the Miami Herald, Edward Hunter, began circulating rumors of advanced Soviet and Chinese “brainwashing” methods, culminating with the publication of <a href="http://cnqzu.com/library/Anarchy%20Folder/Political%20and%20Government/Brain-Washing%20in%20Red%20China%20-%20Edward%20Hunter.pdf" class="broken_link">Brain-washing in Red China: the calculated destruction of men’s minds</a>. Hunter was a former OSS agent who had worked alongside Richard Helms and Howard Hunt in Asia during World War 2. </p>
<p>The Agency took note that prisoners of war who had escaped captivity v the northeastern via the Chinese region of Manchuria had exhibited signs of missing time. In 1959, Richard Condon wrote his bestselling ‘The Manchurian Candidate’, inspiring two movies, and an <a href="http://www.spyculture.com/fbi-investigated-richard-condon-manchurian-candidate-film-blamed-jfk-assassination/">FBI investigation</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="emphasis"><p>“Following this <span style="color: #666; background-color: #666;">BLACKEDOUT</span> commented on the very interesting angle that interrogations of the individuals who had come out of North Korea across the Soviet Union to freedom recently had apparently had a “blank” period or period of disorientation while passing through a special zone in Manchuria.  <span style="color: #666; background-color: #666;">BLACKEDOUT</span> pointed out that this had occurred in all individuals in the party after they had had their first full meal and their first coffee on the way to freedom.  <span style="color: #666; background-color: #666;">BLACKEDOUT</span> pointed out that <span style="color: #666; background-color: #666;">BLACKEDOUT</span> was attempting to secure further confirmatory facts in this matter since drugging was indicated.”</p>
<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 62.5%;">― MORI ID: <a href="http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/mkultra/MKULTRA1/DOC_0000144996/DOC_0000144996.pdf">144996</a><br />
July 15th, 1953</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The CIA eventually determined that returning prisoners of war <a href="http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/mkultra/MKULTRA1/DOC_0000146093/DOC_0000146093.pdf">had not been subjected to the advanced brainwashing</a> methods described by Hunter. Nevertheless, the rumors helped with funding and in disproved allegations of using biochemical weapons.</p>
<p>Early efforts in using drugs, sleep induction, and hypnosis to create a Manchurian candidate appears to be successful.</p>
<p>In simulated exercises conducted in 1951, two hypnotized subjects assembled, planted, and detonated bombs in response to specific codewords. Both subjects were unable to recall anything. They had no memories whatsoever of their actions. (H = Hypnosis; SI= Sleep Induction)</p>

Upon receiving the call, a person known as “Jim” would engage her in normal conversation. During the course of the conversation, this individual would mention a code word to <span style="color: #666; background-color: #666;">BLACKEDOUT</span> . When she heard this code word, she would pass into a SI trance state, but would not close her eyes and remain perfectly normal and continue the telephone conversation. She was told that upon conclusion of the telephone conversation, she would carry out instructions:</p>
<p>…was shown an electric timing device. She was informed that this device was an incendiary bomb and was then instructed how to attach and set the device. After <span style="color: #666; background-color: #666;">BLACKEDBLACKEDOUT</span> learned how to set and attach the device, she was told to return to asleep state and further instructed that upon concluding the aforementioned conversation, she would take the timing device which was in a briefcase, and proceed to the ladies room.

It has also been shown by experimentation with these girls that they can act as unwilling couriers for information purposes and that they can be conditioned to a point where they believe a change in identity on their part even on the polygraph.”</p>

This would remain the official story as far as the public and Olson’s family were concerned until the 1975 publication of the <a href="https://archive.org/details/reporttopresiden01unit">Rockefeller Commission Report</a>. </p>
<p>The report did not mention Olson by name, but <a href="https://archive.org/stream/reporttopresiden01unit#page/227/mode/1up">gave enough details</a> for those familiar with his death to recognize him. Frank Olson’s son, Eric, instantly identified his father after reading a <a href="http://www.frankolsonproject.org/Articles/WashPostJune11,1975.html" class="broken_link">Washington Post front page article</a> published the day following the report’s release. </p>
<p>The article also revealed that Olson had been given LSD days before his death, a fact never disclosed to the family. </p>
<p>The family eventually received an out-of-court settlement of $750k, as well as <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080821120008/http://www.frankolsonproject.org/Student%20papers/Ransom/Ransom5.html">an apology from President Ford</a> and CIA Director William Colby. However, after having the body exhumed for reburial, a second autopsy revealed that <a href="http://www.frankolsonproject.org/Articles/StarrsChapter.html" class="broken_link">Olson could have been murdered</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_17088" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17088" style="width: 175px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img src="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/Government-Conspiracy-CIA-Fort-Detrick.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="161" class="size-full wp-image-17088" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17088" class="wp-caption-text">Fort Detrick</figcaption></figure>Frank Olson became involved with the CIA’s mind control program as part of MKNAOMI, a joint CIA-Army program in which Fort Detrick scientists designed and produced chemical and bio weapon delivery devices for the CIA’s operational use. Dr. Olson and other Detrick scientists signed in at Springrove, a Psychic Institute in Maryland <a href="https://youtu.be/Esx_uvr3Rf4">connected to the CIA’s mind control experiments</a>. Olson’s role in ARTICHOKE had made him privy to state secrets revealed in the course of interrogations, including the alleged use of biochemical weapons (Anthrax) by the US in the Korean War. </p>
<figure id="attachment_17090" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17090" style="width: 136px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img src="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/Government-Conspiracy-CIA-Frank-Olson-Statler-Hotel.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="300" class="size-full wp-image-17090" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17090" class="wp-caption-text">Statler Hotel</figcaption></figure>This new information made the circumstances surrounding Olson’s death increasingly suspicious. Frank Olson received a dose of LSD on November 19th 1953, as he attended an <a href="http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/mkultra/MKULTRA1/DOC_0000145019/DOC_0000145019.pdf">ARTICHOKE conference</a> at Deep Creek Lake, a CIA retreat situated in Maryland. At the meeting, Robert Lashbrook decided to spike the whiskey with LSD. Some speculate that higher ups at the CIA feared that Olson might have had loose lips and that he was subjected to ARTICHOKE interrogation to see if he had revealed secrets.</p>
<p>Following the incident, Olson grew depressed and travelled to New York accompanied by Lashbrook to seek help for his condition. He was prescribed bourbon whiskey and sedatives (an unusual prescription for depression, even by 1950s standards) by CIA-affiliated Dr.Harold Abramson. (Subprojects 7, 27, 33, 40). They checked into room 1018A at the Statler Hotel where <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/melissa-roddy/a-terrible-mistake-hp-alb_b_485774.html">CIA assassin Jean Lafitte</a> not-so-coincidentally worked as a bellhop. The next night Olson crashed to his death through a closed window with the curtains and blind drawn while Lashbrook  slept soundly in the same room.</p>
<p>Lashbrook immediately called  a Long Island number and said “Well, he’s gone.”  “That’s too bad.” the voice replied.</p>
<p>Despite the suspicious circumstances surrounding Olson’s death, the family was unable to file suit due to their previous settlement.</p>

<h2>Le Pain Maudit ― The Cursed Bread</h2>
<p><img src="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/Government-Conspiracy-CIA-Pont-St-Esprit.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="168" class="alignright size-full wp-image-17111" />On the 15th of August, 1951, the southern French village of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pont-Saint-Esprit">Pont-Saint-Esprit</a> was suddenly struck with a strange case of widespread madness. A spontaneous outbreak of insanity rapidly spread through the village and soon affected more than 500 people. One resident jumped out of windows believing himself to be a sparrow or a dragonfly, another ceaselessly tried to remove non existing hair from her mouth to avoid choking. In the end, 7 people died, 50 were interned to psychiatric hospitals, and around 300 villagers experienced hallucinations. A local baker was accused of using inferior rye flour causing the mass poisoning.</p>
<p>The following month a group of experts arrived from Switzerland to investigate the source of the outbreak. The group included Dr. Albert Hofmann of Sandoz Chemical, the first man to synthesize LSD in his laboratory years earlier. They determined that a grain ergot (a fungus) present in the regionally-obtained flour had been the culprit for the outbreak. Little did anyone know at the time, the group of biochemists were closely tied to the CIA, who had been testing Sandoz-supplied LSD and other drugs on unwitting subjects as part of their behavior modification research. Sandoz knew that the bread it had been testing for weeks was contaminated, not with grain ergot, but with a “<a href="http://www.voltairenet.org/article164447.html" class="broken_link">diethylamide-like compound</a>”.</p>
<p>In 2009, researcher and author Hank Albarelli received a reply to a Freedom of Information request he had made a decade earlier. The file <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-10996838">included a document labelled</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="emphasis"><p>“Re: Pont-Saint-Esprit and F.Olson Files. SO Span/France Operation file, inclusive Olson. Intel files. Hand carry to Belin &#8211; tell him to see to it that these are buried.” </p></blockquote>
<p>The document was most likely sent by mistake as the CIA soon <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/Hank_Albarelli_Jr/CIA_book/prweb3343724.htm">requested its own document</a> from Albarelli. He also uncovered another <a href="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/Government-Conspiracy-CIA-Albarelli-Pont-St-Esprit-Laffitte-olson-p759-250x300.jpg" title="Note" rel="lightbox">document sent to the members of the Rockefeller Commission</a> in 1975 which also linked Frank Olson to the Pont-Saint-Esprit incident. (also notice Jean Lafitte’s name)</p>
<p>Albarelli believes that Fort Detrick biochemist Frank Olson had been involved in <strong>Operation SPAN</strong>, a  joint CIA /Army project under MKNAOMI, to experiment with the delivery of a LSD-like compound on the population of Pont-Saint-Esprit. One “skeptic” over at Skeptoid.com <a href="https://skeptoid.com/episodes/4373">dissmised Albarelli’s theory</a>, as well as his FOIA documents because the incident “happened two years before MKULTRA was funded”, despite mentioning both BLUEBIRD and ARTICHOKE in the same article.</p>

He appoints Dr. Sidney Gottlieb to head up the the program and transfers all behavior modification research to Gottlieb&#8217;s Technical Service Staff (TSS), the CIA’s science division. (Also known as the Technical Service Division, TSD) Meanwhile ARTICHOKE interrogation units continued field operations for years in parallel with MKULTRA.</p>
<p><em>*The ‘MK’ in the MKULTRA cryptonym indicates that the program is managed by TSS.

CIA doctors researched non-violent methods such as hypnosis, but also used electroshocks, sleep deprivation and other forms of torture… ANYTHING to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>Aware of the stigma associated with working with clandestine agencies, the CIA used a variety of fronts to or cut out to keep itself insulated from researchers. The Agency used cut outs, intermediaries between researchers and the Agency to hide its role. The two major cut outs used by the CIA were the Geishecker Foundation for Medical Research and the Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology. (The latter created though subprojects 48 and 60)</p>
<p>Through these fronts, the CIA forged partnerships with prominent professors and researchers at American universities. Some had TOP SECRET clearance and the full knowledge of working for US intelligence, while other researchers were unwitting, unaware of the identity of their benefactors. Thus, the CIA developed relationships with over 80 institutions, including prestigious universities, hospitals and pharmaceutical manufacturers. </p>
<p>A great number of subprojects were dedicated to the procurement of drugs and chemicals. Others dealt with the development and testing of drugs and chemical, while another group concentrated on non-chemical mind control techniques such as hypnosis and sleep deprivation. Some subprojects dealt with the program&#8217;s logistics, such as renting or building testing facilities.</p>
<p>The majority of subprojects were of direct interest to the Agency and had a reasonable expectancy of having a use in field operations. Others were meant to forge relationships with a persons of interest to the CIA. They could be called upon at when needed at a later time. Others were simply financed to give the cutouts legitimacy as research institutions.</p>
<p>The CIA financed a wide range of experiments.  Subproject 119 sought to remotely control the human mind. Researcher in Subproject 136 was a study of extrasensory perception (ESP) to evaluate its use in intelligence gathering. Subproject 121 funded research into African witch doctors. Subproject 143 financed the development of a bacteria for the sabotage of petroleum products. In 1967, the CIA successfully contaminated a Cuba-bound oil shipment causing widespread engine failures and breakdowns.</p>

<p>Subproject 35 funded the construction of the Gorman Building, an annex at the Georgetown University Hospital. In return Charles Geishecker offered the Agency cover for at least one agent and access to space and beds to conduct clandestine chemical and biological experiments.</p>
<p>José Delgado, a neurosurgeon and professor at Yale received funding from the Office of Naval Research, the Air Force, and the Public Health Service to research brain implants to remotely control animals. He is best known for implanting electrodes into a bull and being able <a href="https://youtu.be/23pXqY3X6c8">to control its actions remotely</a>.  The CIA explored Delgado’s work in subproject 94 in which researchers implanted rats, donkeys, and dogs with electrodes to use them in surveillance or bugging operations. Later, subproject 142 researchers would implant electrodes in cold-blooded animal to use them as delivery systems for bioweapons or chemical weapons and for other “executive actions”, spyspeak for assassination.</p>

Eastabrooks</figcaption></figure>One of the early proponents of using hypnosis in field operations was the chairman of Psychology at Colgate College, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Estabrooks">George Eastabrooks</a>. Eastabrooks wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0006AUXRY/illuminatirex-20">Hypnotism</a> in 1943 in which he dedicated an entire chapter to the uses of hypnotism in warfare. Estabrooks claimed that he could use hypnosis to trigger multiple personalities, thus creating easily commanded spies with no memories of their actions &#8211; A Manchurian Candidate.</p>
<p>Following the Moscow Show Trials in which accused defendants testified to crimes they most certainly did not commit, Eastabrooks was called to Washington by the War Department. The professor soon ceased publishing indicating that his work had become classified. He contracted for Navy intelligences and advised the CIA. Additionally, the professor took the unusual precaution of burning his diaries from 1940 to 1945.</p>
<p>In 1952, the CIA showed interest in Estabrooks’ 1943 book and quoted portions  in an internal document without mentioning the professor&#8217;s name. In March 1952, The CIA also took notice of Estabrooks’ book and cited some passages in a memo.</p>

<p>In 1971, Estabrooks admitted in a <a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~txporter/scidig.htm">Science Digest article</a> that he had successfully programmed and used mind-controlled couriers during World War 2.</p>
<p>Estabrooks ideas <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000140391.pdf">were nothing new</a> to the Agency. TSS and MKULTRA researchers wondered if hypnosis could be used in field operations and continued to fund research into hypnosis begun by BLUEBIRD/ARTICHOKE researchers.</p>
<p>Eight subprojects (5, 25, 29, 39, 43, 49, 73, and 128 ) involved hypnosis research, with some combining hypnosis with drugs (Narco-Hypnosis). A paper attached to <a href="http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/mkultra/MKULTRA2/DOC_0000190713/DOC_0000190713.pdf">a 1954 memo asked</a>, “Can a Subject be Hypnotised Against His Will?”, and concluded that it could only be done with the use of drugs. </p>
<p>MKULTRA researchers successfully used hypnosis in simulations. In early 1954, an unknown CIA employee <a href="http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/mkultra/MKULTRA2/DOC_0000190713/DOC_0000190713.pdf">was given a false identity while under hypnosis</a>.

On February 10th, 1954, CIA doctors successfully created a Manchurian Candidate assassin. A hypnotised subject fired a pistol at another subject before collapsing into a deep sleep.  Of course, the pistol had not been loaded and again, the subject was totally amnesic of her actions.</p>

<h2>The CIA and LSD</h2>
<figure id="attachment_17083" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17083" style="width: 175px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img src="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/Government-Conspiracy-CIA-ARMY-LSD-Tests.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="158" class="size-full wp-image-17083" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17083" class="wp-caption-text">LSD Army Tests</figcaption></figure>The CIA soon heard of a discovery by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann at <a href="https://youtu.be/cWQkJwdt3CQ">Sandoz</a> Laboratories in Switzerland. They determined that Hofmann’s lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) might just be the elusive drug the Agency had been looking for. Gottlieb tested LSD on Army soldiers stationed at Edgewood Arsenal in 1953 under Operation MKNAOMI.</p>
<p>The CIA panicked after hearing that Sandoz was in the process of synthesizing millions of LSD doses. They feared that the Soviets might gain possession of the drug and were determined to buy the entire lot. Unfortunately, the US military attache in Switzerland providing the information was unfamiliar with the metric system and mistook milligrams for kilograms, a difference between <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=100+kilograms+in+milligram" class="broken_link">100 million doses, and 100</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_17112" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17112" style="width: 175px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img src="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/Government-Conspiracy-CIA-Potential-New-Agent-for-Unconventional-Warfare.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="250" class="size-full wp-image-17112" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17112" class="wp-caption-text">Potential New Agent for Unconventional Warfare<br />(MORI ID: <a href="http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/mkultra/MKULTRA1/DOC_0000148381/DOC_0000148381.pdf">148381</a></figcaption></figure>By 1954 the CIA had established a domestic source for LSD.  MKULTRA <a href="http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/mkultra/mkultra4/DOC_0000017459/DOC_0000017459.pdf">Subproject 6 and 18 provided funds to pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly</a> to crack the LSD formula. The company was soon able to provide the  Agency with LSD in “tonnage quantity”, allowing for wider testing. A memorandum entitled <a href="http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/mkultra/MKULTRA1/DOC_0000148381/DOC_0000148381.pdf">Potential New Agent for Unconventional Warfare</a> described how to use a syringe to spike a cigarette with a dose of LSD. They also developed a field guide, <strong>LSD, Some Unpsychedelic Application</strong>, but all copies lost or destroyed.</p>
<p>Researchers were eager to experiment with the new drug. Psychotherapists believed it could hold the key to curing alcoholism or, in keeping with the times, homosexuality.  The CIA gladly funded research grants and as a result LSD was made widely available throughout the United States. The forerunners of LSD research were <strong>Harold Abramson</strong> at Mt. Sinai Hospital and Columbia University, <strong>Bob Hyde</strong> at Boston Psychopathic, <strong>Harold Hodge</strong> at University of Rochester, <strong>Carl Pfeiffer</strong> at the University of Illinois Medical School, <strong>Louis J. West</strong> at the University of Oklahoma, and <strong>Harris Isbell</strong> at the Center for Addiction Research in Lexington, Kentucky. The latter once <a href="http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/mkultra/MKULTRA2/DOC_0000151524/DOC_0000151524.pdf">administered LSD to seven black Heroin addicts</a> for 77 straight days with double, triple, and even quadruple doses.</p>
<p>Louis J, West, who had TOP SECRET, achieved some fame after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2004/feb/26/research.science">killing Tusko</a>, Oklahoma City Zoo&#8217;s beloved elephant with an overdose of LSD. West headed MKULTRA Subproject 43 and found promising leads on how to influence a subject’s suggestibility to hypnosis by using drugs and sensory deprivation to induce a dissociative state. Interestingly, he was called upon in his role as a psychiatrist to examine and evaluate Jack Ruby, Timothy McVeigh and Patty Hearst. He was also one of many <a href="https://isgp-studies.com/false-memory-syndrome-foundation-fmsf">questionable board members of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation</a> with ties to the CIA and MKULTRA, leading many to doubt the organisation’s credibility.</p>
<p>Harvard psychology professor Timothy Leary and others soon started experimenting with the drug themselves giving rise to the counterculture. John Lennon said “We must always remember to thank the CIA and the Army for LSD, by the way.” and felt that “the Man’s plan had backfired”. “They brought out LSD to control people, and what they did was give us freedom.”  Some theorize that the CIA deliberately flooded the US with LSD in order to <a href="https://wikispooks.com/w/images/a/a0/Acid_dreams.pdf">discredit the New Left</a>. Turning on, tuning in, and most importantly for the Establishment, dropping out, as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_on,_tune_in,_drop_out">dropping out</a> of the political process.</p>

<p>—George Hunter White</figcaption></figure>But the CIA needed more. They required a realistic environment to test new drugs and the efficiency of delivery methods&#8230;</p>
<h2>Operation Midnight Climax</h2>
<p>The operation (Subprojects 3, 14, 16, 42, 149) involved CIA-administered safe houses fitted with with microphones and cameras to which prostitutes lured unsuspecting johns. There, the hapless men were drugged with LSD or other drugs without their knowledge and observed through a <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Tell-if-a-Mirror-Is-Two-Way-or-Not">two-way mirror</a>. These observations helped develop sexual blackmail and surveillance techniques that were soon used in CIA field operations.</p>
<p>Gottlieb appointed George White of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Narcotics">Narcotics Bureau</a> to head up the operation working undercover as a “seaman&#8221; by the name of Morgan Hall. The Agency first set up a safe house in New York&#8217;s’ Greenwich Village and later opened similar safehouses in San Francisco. The prostitutes known as “George’s Girls” were protected from arrest.</p>
<p>CIA Inspector General John Earman <a href="https://archive.org/details/DOC_0000017748">strongly recommended closing the safe houses</a> after discovering of their existence in 1963.</p>

<h2>Ewen Cameron</h2>
<figure id="attachment_17105" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17105" style="width: 168px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img src="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/Government-Conspiracy-CIA-MKULTRA-Donald-Ewen-Cameron.jpg" alt="" width="168" height="220" class="size-full wp-image-17105" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17105" class="wp-caption-text">Ewen Cameron</figcaption></figure>Dr. Ewen Cameron was highly esteemed in the field of psychiatry. He was the President of the Canadian Psychiatric Association, American Psychiatric Association, and the World Psychiatric Association, chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at McGill University in Canada and director of the Allan Memorial Institute, a mental asylum affiliated to McGill. Cameron had travelled to Nuremberg to evaluate Rudolph Hess for his trial.</p>
<p>Despite his impeccable credentials and his familiarity with the Nuremberg Code, including the notion of consent, Cameron was in actually a demented monster with a love for electroshocks and a penchant for lobotomies, conducting experiments on his patients without their informed consent.</p>
<p>Cameron received funding from the Rockefeller Foundation and then through a CIA cutout, the Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology, under MKULTRA Subproject 68. The CIA was interested in Cameron’s work because he claimed he could erase memories and implant new ones. Cameron pursued research into what he called “depatterning”. His “treatment” involved electroshocks and drug-induced comas, which, he hoped, would allow him to erase memories, reprogram human brains, and cure schizophrenia. </p>
<p>Patients slept in a small room nicknamed the “Sleep Room” for periods of 2 to 3 months while listening to recorded messages played on a loop, a process he called “psychic driving”. One patient remembers one of these messages: “You killed your mother.” (He hadn’t.) The patients were periodically awakened with a massive doses of amphetamine and a series of electroshocks, up to 40 times stronger than what is considered safe for humans.</p>
<p>Linda McDonald was one of Cameron’s unfortunate patient. Diagnosed as an acute schizophrenic, she was taken to the Sleep Room where she slept for 86 consecutive days while enduring 109 shock treatments and megadoses of amphetamines. Cameron considered her cured and a great success! However McDonald was unable to complete basic tasks on her own and had to be toilet trained. She had no memory of her husband and children.</p>
<p>She and a group of former Cameron patients sued the US government. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/06/world/cia-near-settlement-of-lawsuit-by-subjects-of-mind-control-tests.html">CIA settled the suit out of court</a> with 9 of the plaintiffs for a total of $750K. (The events were dramatized in a 1998 2-part mini-series, <a href="https://youtu.be/7g_Vzd_l9Gg">The Sleep Room</a>.) McDonald herself was ineligible for the settlement since the CIA had ceased payment to Cameron at the time of her treatment.  In a twist, the suit uncovered that the Canadian government had funded Cameron’s research. McDonald and approximately 80 other victims were offered a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/19/world/canada-will-pay-50-s-test-victims.html">settlement of $80k each</a> by the government of Canada.</p>
<p>Without a single patient “cured”, Dr. Ewen Cameron’s treatments soon became part of the <a href="http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB122/CIA%20Kubark%201-60.pdf">KUBARK Torture Manuel</a>. </p>
<h2>Project MKSEARCH</h2>
<p>Following the Bay of Pigs fiasco, John F. Kennedy fired Allen Dulles and appointed John McCone as Director of the CIA. McCone’s created a new directorate dedicated to scientific research. He transferred most of MKULTRA’s subprojects under the new directorate&#8217;s Office of Research and Development (ORD). Thanks to his mentor, Richard Helms, Gottlieb’s is promoted to the number 2 position of the entire Technical Service Division which is expected to continue the operational aspects of MKULTRA.</p>
<p>Gottlieb carefully cherry picks from the 149 MKULTRA subprojects and on June 7th, 1964, moves some of them into 7 individual subprojects under the new cryptonym of MKSEARCH. MKULTRA itself is <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0005444836.pdf">phased out from 1964 to 1967</a>.</p>
<p><strong>MKSEARCH Subproject 1 (MKULTRA 62)</strong><br />
TESTING &#8211; Dr. Maitland Baldwin at the National Institutes of Health was a brain surgeon who had worked with the Agency since its ARTICHOKE days. The CIA was aware that Baldwin was completely nuts but admired his zeal and ideas. He performed lobotomies on apes before placing them in his DIY isolation chamber. (which the CIA flipped the bill for after a freaked out soldier damaged it escaping) He’d remove heads from moneys and place it on another&#8230;that kind of nuttiness.</p>
<p><strong>MKSEARCH Subproject 2 (MKULTRA 78, 110)</strong><br />
PROCUREMENT &#8211; Continuance of a $150k a year contract with Bacteriological and Pharmaceutical Consults, a private laboratory ran by an ex-CIA scientist. The lab could deliver microorganisms quickly and served as backchannel for the procurement of bioweapons without the knowledge of their usual source, the Army’s laboratories at Fort Detrick.</p>
<p><strong>MKSEARCH Subproject 3 (MKULTRA 124, 140)</strong><br />
TESTING &#8211; This source of testing became especially important to Gottlieb following the closure of the safehouse program. Dr. James Hamilton p<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000196947.pdf">rovided payed guinea pigs interned at Vacaville State Prison</a> in California. Between 1967 and 1968, Hamilton experimented on an estimated 400 to 1000 prisoners.</p>
<p><strong>MKSEARCH Subproject 4 (MKULTRA 3, 14, 16, 43)</strong><br />
TESTING &#8211; Gottlieb wished to continue the safehouse program despite the <a href="https://archive.org/details/DOC_0000017748">CIA’s Inspector General recommendation</a> to shut it down.  The testing of drugs on unwitting johns continued unembedded for a few years with the Agency paying out $30k in 1964 to keep the safehouses running. In February 1965, George White spent $1,100 on prostitutes alone.  Under pressure, Gottlieb was forced to end the program and the San Francisco safehouses closed later that year, with the New York safehouse ceasing operations the next year.</p>
<p><strong>MKSEARCH Subproject 5 (MKULTRA 116, 146)</strong><br />
PROCUREMENT &#8211; This project provided Gottlieb with a backchannel for chemical which were difficult to acquire. The source was an unnamed industrialist with his fingers in multiple concerns, including a chemical company. He was a great source of information and able to manufacture and provide the CIA with chemical weapons without alerting anyone outside TSS.</p>
<p><strong>MKSEARCH Subproject 6  (MKULTRA 23, 25, 26)</strong><br />
TESTING &#038; COVER &#8211; Dr. Charles Geschickter continued to provide his Geschickter Fund for the Medical Research as a cover for CIA-sponsored research.  Through this conduit, the Agency continued to fund expeditions into South America for new potential drugs. Geschickter himself gathered data on and experimented on terminally-ill Cancer patients at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington.</p>
<p><strong>MKSEARCH Subproject 7  (MKULTRA 9, 26, 28, 47)</strong><br />
TESTING &#8211; Dr. Pfeiffer provided another source of testing and provided the Agency with the properties of drugs it was interested in. Carl Pfeiffer tested drugs for the CIA at the University of Illinois, Emory University and the United States Penitentiary in Atlanta, as well as the Neuropsychiatric Institute and the Bordentown Reformatory in New Jersey.</p>
<p>PROJECT MKSEARCH continues until June 1972 when Gottlieb becomes increasingly occupied with his duties after being appointed as new head of TSD by his mentor and newly-appointed Director of the CIA, Richard Helms.  </p>
<h2>The End of MKULTRA</h2>
<figure id="attachment_17113" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17113" style="width: 168px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img src="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/Government-Conspiracy-CIA-Richard-Helms.jpg" alt="" width="168" height="151" class="size-full wp-image-17113" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17113" class="wp-caption-text">Richard Helms</figcaption></figure>On the heels of Watergate and in his last days as CIA director, Richard Helm gave the order to destroy all documents and tapes relating to MKULTRA. This was unusual, even by Agency standards, as internal regulations prohibited wholesale destructions of records. On January 31, 1973, Gottlieb dutifully passed on Helm’s instructions to <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0005444812.pdf">destroy all records pertaining to MKULTRA</a> and experiments in human behavior modifications. As justification, Gottlieb testified it was due to a “<a href="https://archive.org/stream/CiaCongressionalHearingsOnHumanDrugTesting/CiaCongressionalHearingsOnSecretChemicalsAndDrugs#page/n185/mode/1up">burgeoning paper problem</a>” while Helms claimed it was to protect professional reputations (Their own, no doubt.) if the public was to hear of the program. </p>
<p>Helm’s instincts were correct. On May 9th, 1973, his replacement as director of the CIA <a href="http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB222/schlesinger_jewels.pdf">James Schlesinger issues a memorandum</a> to all CIA employees to submit records of all operations they believed to be outside the Agency&#8217;s charter. The collected reports become known as the <a href="http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB222/index.htm">Family Jewels</a>, a ticking time bomb containing many of the CIA’s dirtiest secrets. The file includes a <a href="http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB222/top04.pdf">memo to CIA director William Colby</a> suggesting he deny having any knowledge the existence of MKULTRA. It also makes <a href="http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB222/top07.pdf">references to Yuli Nosenko</a>, a Soviet defector who was subjected to ARTICHOKE interrogation techniques for 16 months while being kept in cramped 10&#8217;x 10&#8242; cell.</p>
<figure id="attachment_17095" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17095" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img src="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/Government-Conspiracy-CIA-hersh-New-York-Time-Operation-CHAOS.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="238" class="size-full wp-image-17095" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17095" class="wp-caption-text">New York Times, Dec. 22, 1974</figcaption></figure>Sure enough, contents of the dossier leaked to the press and Seymour Hersh at the <a href="http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/238963/huge-c-i-a-operation-reported-in-u-s-against.pdf">New York Times promptly blows the lid on Operation CHAOS</a>, a huge domestic spying program to keep tabs on hundreds of thousands of US citizens from 1967 to 1974. In response to the public outcry, President Gerald Ford appointed the Rockefeller Commission while Congress formed the Church Committee to investigate illegal activities of the CIA.</p>
<p>Fearful of what such an investigation into MKULTRA might uncover, the CIA waste no time as General Counsel Lawrence Houston immediately travels to Washington to brief Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld, then part of the Ford administration, on Operation Dormouse.</p>

	<!-- shortcode box --> <div class="shortcode clearfix box   ">
<h2>OPERATION DORMOUSE</h2>
<p>Operation Dormouse, as Houston explained, was the Agency’s plan to give the investigators and the media a tasty morsel to chew on in the form of MKULTRA in order to keep revelations of Project ARTICHOKE from reaching the light of day, which in Houston’s opinion, would undo the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
<p>They agreed to throw Dr. Sidney Gottlieb to the wolves (<a href="https://archive.org/stream/CiaCongressionalHearingsOnHumanDrugTesting/CiaCongressionalHearingsOnSecretChemicalsAndDrugs#page/n163/mode/1up">Gottlieb was appalled that his name had not been blacked out</a> in FOIA releases) as well as to reveal ties to Harvard, Yale, Cornell and other prestigious universities and hospitals. This would insure that the universities and the media themselves would act as gatekeepers and justify the CIA excesses and experiments on US citizens.</p>
<p>The plan worked.</p>
<p>The Pandora’s box that was ARTICHOKE remained closed. The public remained focus on  MKULTRA LSD experiments and prostitutes, despite ARTICHOKE operation continuing in parallel with mind control experiments <a href="http://truth-out.org/archive/component/k2/item/89725:cries-from-the-past-tortures-ugly-echoes">for 17 years</a>.</p>
</div> <!-- /shortcode box -->
<p>Due to the wholesale destruction of MKULTRA files the Rockefeller Commission and the Church Committee were forced to rely on a surviving copy of the <a href="https://archive.org/details/DOC_0000017748">1963 Inspector General’s report</a> and the not-so-reliable testimonies of former CIA officers and participant in the MKULTRA program.  </p>
<p>Gottlieb testified to the Church Committee under the name Victor Scheider but couldn’t recall much information and appeared unfamiliar with the projects he was supervising. Interviews of career officers by the Church Committee and the Rockefeller Commission proved largely unhelpful until two years later, when a cache of 7 boxes containing invoices and other MKULTRA financial records <a href="http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/history/e1950/mkultra/Hearing02.htm">were uncovered at a Retired Records Center</a> outside of Washington.</p>
<p>Gottlieb was called back to Washington to testify in 1977. This time he <a href="https://archive.org/stream/CiaCongressionalHearingsOnHumanDrugTesting/CiaCongressionalHearingsOnSecretChemicalsAndDrugs#page/n159/mode/2up">testified under his own name</a> but under condition of immunity. Despite this, the former spook’s testimony was not useful due to what Senator Kennedy described as Gottlieb&#8217;s “<a href="http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/history/e1950/mkultra/Hearing05.htm">fuzzy memory about this whole area</a>”.</p>
<figure id="attachment_17123" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17123" style="width: 168px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img src="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/Government-Conspiracy-CIA-Robert-Lashbrook.jpg" alt="" width="168" height="184" class="size-full wp-image-17123" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17123" class="wp-caption-text">Robert Lashbrook</figcaption></figure>Gottlieb’s number two man, Richard Lashbrook was equally unhelpful going so far as to commit perjury. He testified to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1977/09/05/the-diaries-of-a-cia-operative/65b08a3e-c95a-434e-b1c6-c05f726a3a6f/?utm_term=.16665d5daef8">having no firsthand knowledge of the safe house program</a> (subproject 3) despite being listed as the operation’s supervisor. Furthermore, <a href="https://archive.org/stream/CiaCongressionalHearingsOnHumanDrugTesting/CiaCongressionalHearingsOnSecretChemicalsAndDrugs#page/n100/mode/1up">George White’s diaries</a> revealed that Lashbrook had personally visited the 81 Bedford Street safehouse in Greenwich Village on June 8th and September 16th, 1953.</p>
<p>Lashbrook also revealed that the documents obtained by the committee might be “boilerplate” and not necessarily indicative of the projects’ true purpose. He explained that the CIA used <a href="https://archive.org/stream/CiaCongressionalHearingsOnHumanDrugTesting/CiaCongressionalHearingsOnSecretChemicalsAndDrugs#page/n101/mode/2up">a cover file system</a>, with one set of files containing actual information and another containing boilerplate content only. </p>
<p>In addition to the destruction of evidence and the perjured testimony of witnesses, the investigators themselves were also intent on keeping some parts of the project hidden from the public. Nelson Rockefeller, chairman of the Presidential commission <a href="http://stevenwarran-backstage.blogspot.com/2013/08/why-rockefeller-tried-to-cover-up-cia.html">worked behind the scenes to sabotage his own investigation</a> into illegal CIA activities. Rockefeller was compromised having himself signed off on MKULTRA experiments in federal hospitals while Under Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare in the early 50s.</p>
<h2>LEGACY</h2>
<p>The CIA and their media pundits continue to circulate claims that projects ARTICHOKE and MKULTRA were failure that resulted in nothing of any use to the US intelligence.  Gottlieb himself concluded shortly before his death that “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/10/us/sidney-gottlieb-80-dies-took-lsd-to-cia.html">The experiments were useless&#8230;</a>”. </p>
<figure id="attachment_17122" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17122" style="width: 168px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img src="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/Government-Conspiracy-CIA-Miles-Copeland.jpg" alt="" width="168" height="182" class="size-full wp-image-17122" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17122" class="wp-caption-text">“You wouldn’t believe what those weirdos come up with! The congressional subcommittee which went into this sort of thing got only the barest glimpse.”<br />― Miles Copeland<br /></figcaption></figure>This is inconsistent with the Agency’s own records, some of which I’ve quoted and linked above that demonstrate that aspects of the program were successful and applied in interrogations and other field operations.  It is unlikely that the CIA would have dedicated so many resources for over two decades conducting useless experiments. Additionally, Gottlieb receives the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinguished_Intelligence_Medal">Distinguished Intelligence Medal</a>, given for “outstanding services or for achievement of a distinctly exceptional nature in a duty or responsibility”. Again, not the sort of thing given out for 20+ years of consistent failures.</p>
<p>CIA Director Admiral Stansfield Turner’s statement that the Agency was <a href="http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/history/e1950/mkultra/Hearing02.htm">no longer involved in behavior modification research</a> is also contradicted by the sheer amount of research accumulated on the subject. The CIA’s Office of Research and Development did not stay idle following taking over the duties of MKULTRA.  Author John Marks whose earlier FOIA request uncovered the 7 missing boxes in 1977 refiled a similar request for the Office of Research and Development and received a response that 130 boxes of document were available. </p>
<p>To this day, the CIA and other intelligence agencies continue to experiment with drugs and methods that will give them an edge in interrogations. Whistleblower Victor Marchetti confirmed in 1977 that the programs were continuing.</p>

<h2>What is Project MONARCH?</h2>
<p>Distrust for the CIA and the desire to fill the gaps left behind by Agency lies and cover-ups have giving rise to a questionable theories surrounding its mind control projects. </p>
<p>Researchers into MKULTRA and other government mind control programs are bound to run into claims of “Monarch” mind control programming. MONARCH involved the kidnapping and torture of children to turn them into sex slaves and spies for operational use.</p>

<strong>Project MONARCH</strong> is an alleged government black program to create mind-controlled slave for use as spies, assassins, couriers, and prostitutes. Monarchs carry out their assignments and consequently have no memory of their actions. According to some estimates, there are over 2 million Americans currently under mind control.</p>
<p>Monarch slaves are taken as infants and are traumatized using electroshocks, drugs, sexual abuse, mind games, and hypnosis in order to force the mind to split and create an alternative personality to deal with the pain. <strong>The victim imagines that someone else is being tortured and the mind is forced to split.</strong> Each personality (or <strong>alter</strong>, as in ‘<u><strong>alter</strong></u>nate personality’ ) is then programmed and trained to perform specific tasks and missions. </p>
<p>One alter can be a deadly assassin, trained in martial arts, explosives, and weaponry. While another, an innocent looking courier carrying clandestine messages between world leaders, mob bosses, puppet dictators, and Hollywood insiders. Alters perform their assignments without the knowledge of the host’s main or front personality.  The traumas create amnesia walls between the different personalities, meaning that each alter is totally unaware of the existence of the others.</p>
<p>Although, accounts vary on the exact methods used, the common key ingredient is trauma. Lots of it. </p>
<p>Monarchs can have hundreds of different alters coexisting inside them. Programmers insert codes and signals which are used by controllers to call up different personalities and give command. For example, <em>“Mission Completed DIA-5018”</em>  will cause the slave to go into a deep sleep. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2757.png" alt="❗" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><strong>Note</strong>: If you fall asleep immediately reading this phrase, you might be a mind-control slave.</p>
<h2>Greek Letter Programs</h2>
<p>Major program levels are often named after Greek letters but these can be unique to each programmer or for each individual mind-controlled slave.</p>
<p><strong>ALPHA</strong> &#8211; General Programming &#8211; This is the first programming put in. It includes giving slaves a photographic memory that record everything every alters see or hear.</p>
<p><strong>BETA</strong> &#8211; Sexual Programming &#8211; These alters are instructed in the art of seduction and sexual pleasure. Betas take part in ritual sex, acting and directing child pornography, and prostitution.  Those trained as sex kittens often see themselves as cats </p>
<p>Top BETAS are known as <strong>Presidential Models</strong>; as the title implies, they discretely service Presidents, Royalty, and other high-ranking government officials. They regularly hang around the White House.</p>
<p><strong>DELTA</strong> &#8211; Assassination Programming &#8211; Alters trained in combat, assassination, and espionage.</p>
<p><strong>THETA</strong> &#8211; Psychic Killer Programming &#8211; Psychic assassins able to cause aneurysms from anywhere. Anytime. They telepathically communicate with “Mother”.</p>
<p><strong>GAMMA</strong> &#8211; Deception Programming &#8211; These alters are trained as deceivers. They spread disinformation and are able to throw a therapist off track.</p>
<p><strong>OMEGA</strong> &#8211; Suicide Programming &#8211; Alters programmed for self-mutilation and self-destruction. </p>
<p>Children of Monarch slaves, emitting from multi-generational families, are known as <strong>Bloodliners</strong>.  They are considered superior to <strong>Non-Bloodliners</strong>, who are often kidnapped off the street or purchased from underground child trafficking rings. Non-bloodliners are deemed expandable  and are often sacrificed in blood rituals or unceremoniously murdered to terrify and further traumatized bloodliners.</p>
<h2>Walt Disney and Hollywood Mind Control</h2>
<p><img src="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/what-is-monarch-mind-control-Walt-Disney-210x210.jpg" alt="what-is-monarch-mind-control-walt-disney" width="210" height="210" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-16449" />Disney, the man, the studio, and the theme parks are often cited by Monarch victims as an essential part of the government’s mind control program. Programmers use electroshock in combination with Fantasia’s imagery to induce dissociative personalities and for programming. Program runners realized that bringing in people from all over the world to military facilities would eventually give rise to suspicions, so they worked with Walt Disney in designing his theme parks to include facilities for mind control programming. Many of the rides are designed for use in mind control and to traumatize young children.</p>
<p>MGM’s Wizard of Oz and Disney’s Alice in Wonderland are favorites of Monarch programmers. Victims are told to go “over the rainbow”, or “there’s no place like home” to reach a safe place in Wizard of Oz programming or “go through the looking-glass” if using Alice in Wonderland.  “Follow the yellow Brick Road.” or “Follow the White Rabbit” are triggers to follow the programmer’s commands.</p>
<p>Illuminati programmers designed Star Wars for use in trauma-base mind control programming.</p>
<p>Monarch programming is also used on the masses via movies, televisions, and music. They are used to desensitize the public or to trigger programs in mind-controlled slaves. Websites such as <a href="http://illuminatimovies.net/">IlluminatiMovies</a> and <a href="http://vigilantcitizen.com/">VigilantCitizen </a>are dedicated to analyzing Hollywood movies from the perspective of Monarch.</p>

<h2>Is Project MONARCH Real?</h2>
<p>Is there any proof of Monarch’s existence?</p>
<p><strong>No.</strong> There is no proof. </p>
<p>The evidence for the existence of Project MONARCH comes entirely in the form of victim testimonies, which are often based on memories recovered through hypnosis.</p>
<p>The program is often described as a subproject of <a href="http://www.illuminatirex.com/project-mk-ultra/">MKULTRA</a>, an acknowledged CIA program into mind control and behavior modification. </p>
<p>There is no doubt that the government had/has an interest in controlling minds and that employed drugs, hypnosis, electroshocks, radiation, and other forms of torture on US citizens without their consent to achieve its aims.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at government research that possibly relate to Project MONARCH that could give legitimacy to claims of the project’s existence. </p>
<h2>US Government Behavior Modification Research</h2>
<p>As the United States grew into its role of world superpower, it developed an interest in mind control and a desire to control human behavior. At the same time Nazi scientist Dr. Kurt Plötner experimented with mescaline on prisoners at Dachau to “eliminate the will of the person examined”, Dr. Winfred Overholser performed similar experiments on unwitting subject at St. Elizabeth Hospital in Washington, DC. Plötner was eventually recruited by US intelligence as part of <a href="http://www.illuminatirex.com/top-ten-government-conspiracies/#PAPERCLIP">Operation Paperclip</a>, a post-war program to recruit valuable Nazi scientists and identify and useful research. </p>
<figure id="attachment_16450" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-16450" style="width: 197px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img src="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/what-is-monarch-mind-control-Sidney-Gottlieb.jpg" alt="“The experiments were useless.” ~Sidney Gottlieb, Head of MKULTRA 1953-1973" width="197" height="236" class="size-full wp-image-16450" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-16450" class="wp-caption-text"><em>“The experiments were useless.”</em> ~Sidney Gottlieb, Head of MKULTRA 1953-1973</figcaption></figure>Following the outbreak of World War 2, Navy intelligence and the Army Chemical Corps began developing methods of mind control. The CIA’s predecessor, the OSS experimented with different strains of marijuana to develop an effective truth serum. In 1947, Naval Intelligence launched Project CHATTER to study the efficiency of various drugs in interrogations.</p>
<p>The CIA entered the mind control game in 1950 with the <a href="http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/mkultra/MKULTRA1/DOC_0000144900/DOC_0000144900.pdf">creation of Project BLUEBIRD</a> (MORI ID: <a href="http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/mkultra/MKULTRA1/DOC_0000144900/DOC_0000144900.pdf">144900</a>) with former Naval intelligence officer Morse Allan heading the program. Initially, the program <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000140401.pdf">researched hypnosis and sleep induction</a> for use in extracting information from foreign agents as well as safeguarding information from the enemy employing similar techniques. (MORI ID: <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000140401.pdf">140401</a>)</p>
<p>Researchers quickly forgot the notion of consent so-praised a few years earlier for its inclusion in the <a href="https://history.nih.gov/research/downloads/nuremberg.pdf">Nuremberg Code</a>. Soon, apologists were using the same excuses as Nazis convicted as war criminals to justify their research.  CIA doctors broke their Hippocratic Oaths in which they swore to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primum_non_nocere">abstain from doing harm</a>.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1951, <a href="http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/mkultra/MKULTRA1/DOC_0000149489/DOC_0000149489.pdf">BLUEBIRD is renamed ARTICHOKE</a> (MORI ID: <a href="http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/mkultra/MKULTRA1/DOC_0000149489/DOC_0000149489.pdf">149489</a>) for security reasons as the old cryptonym was known to many contractors no longer associated with the program.</p>
<p>In 1953 <a href="https://archive.org/details/DOC_0000017748">Allen Dulles authorized MKULTRA</a> (MORI ID: <a href="https://archive.org/details/DOC_0000017748">17748</a>), an umbrella program which would eventually grow to  encompass <a href="http://www.illuminatirex.com/list-of-mkultra-subprojects/">149 subprojects</a>. He appointed Sidney Gottlieb to run the program and transferred all behavior modification research to Gottlieb’s Technical Service Staff. (TSS, later renamed the Technical Service Division, TSD) ARTICHOKE continued to operate in parallel with MKULTRA for a few more years.</p>
<p>CIA research into mind control became publicly known in the mid 70s mainly through the Rockefeller Commission and the Church Committee.</p>

In 1943, he wrote <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0006AUXRY/illuminatirex-20">Hypnotism</a></em> in which he dedicated a chapter to the the discussion of the uses of hypnotism in warfare.</p>
<p>Following the outbreak of World War 2, Estabrooks was called to Washington by the War Department.</p>
<p>In March 1952, The CIA also took notice of Estabrooks’ book and cited some passages in a memo.</p>
<blockquote class="emphasis"><p>“I can hypnotize a man &#8212; without his knowledge or consent &#8212; into committing treason against the United States. If I can do it, so could psychologists of other nations in the event of another war.”</p>

Although Estabrooks’ name is blacked out, it’s easy enough to compare the style and content to his 1971 article (below) to determine that he is the author. </p>
<p>He first outlines how he able to a create hypnotic messenger who have no memory of the message content or of having delivered said message.</p>
<blockquote class="emphasis"><p>“In deep hypnosis the subject, military or civilian, can be given a message to be delivered to say Colonel X in Berlin. The subject may then be sent to Berlin on any perfectly routine assignment. The message will be perfectly safe because </p>
<p>a. the subject will have no memory whatsoever in the waking state as to the nature and contents of the message. </p>
<p>b. it can be arranged that the subject will have no knowledge of ever having been hypnotized. </p>
<p>c. It can be arranged that no one beside Colonel X in Berlin can hypnotize the subject and recover the message.”</p></blockquote>
<figure id="attachment_16453" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-16453" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000140402.pdf"><img src="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/what-is-monarch-mind-control-military-applications-of-hypnosis.jpg" alt="THE MILITARY APPLICATION OF HYPNTISM" width="250" height="320" class="size-full wp-image-16453" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-16453" class="wp-caption-text">THE MILITARY APPLICATION OF HYPNTISM [sic] (MORI ID: <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000140402.pdf">140402</a>)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Eastabrooks then explains how hypnotic sleeper agents could infiltrate enemy groups without being consciously aware that they are actually loyal Americans gathering information on the enemy. Note that Eastabrooks claimed he could use hypnosis to create a split personality as discussed in MONARCH conspiracies.</p>
<blockquote class="emphasis"><p>“I will take a number of men and will establish in them through the use of hypnotism the condition of split personality. Consciously they will be ardent Communists, phanatical adherents to the party line ready and eager to submit to any discipline which the party may prescribe. Unconsciously they will be loyal Americans determined just as grimley determined to thwart the Communists at every turn in the road.</p></blockquote>
<p>He adds:</p>
<blockquote class="emphasis"><p>“This sounds unbelievable, but I assure you, it will work.”</p>
<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 62.5%;">― <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000140402.pdf">THE MILITARY APPLICATION OF HYPNTISM</a> [SIC] <br />(MORI ID: <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000140402.pdf">140402</a> &#8211; See MORI ID <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000140391.pdf">140391</a> for the CIA’s response)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1968 Estabrooks told a reporter for the <em>Providence Evening Bulletin</em> (Rhode Island) that <em>“the key to creating an effective spy or assassin rests in splitting a man&#8217;s personality, or creating multipersonality, with the aid of hypnotism. This is not science fiction. This has and is being done. I have done it.”</em></p>
<p>In 1971, Estabrooks once again praised the merits of hypnosis in Science Digest in which he claimed to have successfully used hypnotic couriers in clandestine operations as first described in his 1954 CIA proposal. </p>
<blockquote><p>“The &#8220;hypnotic courier,&#8221; on the other hand, provides a unique solution. I was involved in preparing many subjects for this work during World War II. One successful case involved an Army Service Corps Captain whom we&#8217;ll call George Smith.</p>
<p>Captain Smith had undergone months of training. He was an excellent subject but did not realize it. I had removed from him, by post-hypnotic suggestion, all recollection of ever having been hypnotized.</p>
<p>First I had the Service Corps call the captain to Washington and tell him they needed a report of the mechanical equipment of Division X headquartered in Tokyo. Smith was ordered to leave by jet next morning, pick up the report and return at once. Consciously, that was all he knew, and it was the story he gave to his wife and friends.</p>
<p>Then I put him under deep hypnosis, and gave him &#8212; orally &#8212; a vital message to be delivered directly on his arrival in Japan to a certain colonel &#8212; let&#8217;s say his name was Brown &#8212; of military intelligence. Outside of myself, Colonel Brown was the only person who could hypnotize Captain Smith. This is &#8220;locking.&#8221; I performed it by saying to the hypnotized Captain: &#8220;Until further orders from me, only Colonel Brown and I can hypnotize you. We will use a signal phrase &#8216;the moon is clear.&#8217; Whenever you hear this phrase from Brown or myself you will pass instantly into deep hypnosis.&#8221; When Captain Smith re-awakened, he had no conscious memory or what happened in trance. All that he was aware of was that he must head for Tokyo to pick up a division report.</p>
<p>On arrival there, Smith reported to Brown, who hypnotized him with the signal phrase. Under hypnosis, Smith delivered my message and received one to bring back. Awakened, he was given the division report and returned home by jet. There I hypnotized him once more with the signal phrase, and he spieled off Brown&#8217;s answer that had been dutifully tucked away in his unconscious mind.</p>
<p>The system is virtually foolproof. As exemplified by this case, the information was &#8220;locked&#8221; in Smith&#8217;s unconscious for retrieval by the only two people who knew the combination. The subject had no conscious memory of what happened, so could not spill the beans. No one else could hypnotize him even if they might know the signal phrase.”</p>

<h2>The Strange Case of Candy Jones: Hypnotic Courier, Spy, Assassin, Cover Model</h2>

She married her boss, fashion tycoon Harry Conover but the couple divorced and she was left with little to her name.
<p>She opened a modeling training school but ran into financial difficulties. She was then recruited by the CIA to receive and deliver packages. Unbeknownst to Jones, the CIA had used hypnosis to create a second personality, Arlene Grant, trained in espionage and assassination.</p>
<p>Arlene worked as a CIA asset for over a decade. She traveled on clandestine missions all over the world while Candy remained totally unaware of her secret life. Arlene could be triggered by telephone using secret codes. Jones began recovering her memories of Arlene in 1972, soon after marrying radio host and amateur hypnotist, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_John_Nebel">Long John Nebel</a>.</p>
<p>Nebel found his new bride especially moody and determined to find the cause of her “moments of bitchiness” using hypnosis. He soon discovered the existence of Arlene the spy and subsequently recorded over 200 hours of their conversations. Jones recalled how the CIA had used hypnosis, drugs, sexual abuse, as well as torture to turn her into an assassin. </p>
<p>She remembers training for the Bay of Pigs Invasion at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Peary">Camp Peary</a> (the Farm), having a candle inserted into her vagina at Langley, and being tortured for information in Taiwan. Jones found a passport in the name of Arlene Grant, a key to mailbox #1294 at Grand Central Station, and a cryptic Japan Airlines message confirming that “<strong>C</strong>ynth<strong>IA</strong>” was holding a ticket to Tokyo In Arlene&#8217;s’ name.</p>
<p>The couple invited their friend and author Donald Bain to listen to the taped sessions. He wrote <a href="http://hilobrow.com/2016/03/25/planet-of-peril-2/">The Control of Candy Jones</a> in 1976 which became a bestseller. Jones stood by her story until <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/19/obituaries/candy-jones-dies-ex-model-teacher-and-writer-was-64.html">her death in 1990</a>.</p>

<p>In early 1950, CIA researchers were aware that electroshocks were effective in guaranteeing amnesia. (MORI ID: <a href="https://archive.org/details/DOC_0000190885">190885</a>)</p>
<p>By mid-1951, Morse Allen of ARTICHOKE employed a well-known stage hypnotist to instruct his agents in the art of hypnosis. (MORI ID: <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000140393.pdf">140393</a>) The hypnotist bragged about fooling married women into sleeping with him by making them believe that he was their husband.  He also revealed that he was involved in successfully creating hypnotic couriers during World War 2 for an intelligence agency so secret, he would only utter its initials. </p>
<p>In simulated exercises in the fall of the same year, two subjects subjected to H [hypnosis] and SI [sleep induction] were made to assemble, plant, and detonate bombs in response to specific codewords. (MORI ID: <a href="http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/mkultra/MKULTRA2/DOC_0000190527/DOC_0000190527.pdf">190527</a>)  Despite having just set off bombs that would have undoubtedly killed them in real life, both subject were unable to recall their actions. They were totally amnesiac.</p>
<blockquote class="emphasis"><p>“&nbsp;<span style="color: black; background-color: black;">BLACKEDOUT</span> was instructed that upon awakening, she would proceed to <span style="color: black; background-color: black;">BLACKEDOUT</span> room where she would wait at the desk for a telephone call. Upon receiving the call, a person known as &#8220;Jim&#8221; would engage her in normal conversation. During the course of the conversation, this individual would mention a code word to  <span style="color: black; background-color: black;">BLACKEDOUT</span> . When she heard this code word, she would pass into a SI trance state, but would not close her eyes and remain perfectly normal and continue the telephone conversation. She was told that upon conclusion of the telephone conversation, she would carry out instructions: </p>
<p>&#8230;was shown an electric timing device. She was informed that this device was an incendiary bomb and was then instructed how to attach and set the device.

In March 1951, twenty-year old <a href="https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palle_Hardrup">Palle Hardrup</a> robbed a Copenhagen bank at gunpoint, killing two bank employees in the process. He made his getaway by bicycle and hid in the stairway of a nearby building where police soon apprehended him.
<p>Hardrup did not implicate anyone else at first. Police identify the bicycle&#8217;s owner as Bjorn Nielsen and learned that the pair had shared a cell at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsens_Statsf%C3%A6ngsel">Horsens State Prison</a> for 18-months before their release in 1949. Fellow inmates reported to investigators that Nielsen kept Hardup in an hypnotic trance for hours a day. By December of 1951, Hardrup had recovered his memories of the event and withdrew his confession. He claimed to have been under hypnosis and named Nielsen as the mastermind and architect of the robbery. </p>
<p>Police arrested Nielsen for his role in the robbery and double murder. The court-appointed doctor found Hardrup to be highly susceptible to hypnosis once he was able to undo the locks put in place by Nielsen. Nielsen received a sentence of life imprisonment. Meanwhile, Hardrup was committed to a psychiatric prison and <a href="http://drabssageridanmark.beboer2650.dk/html/drabssager_-_1951.html">released in late 1966</a>. </p>

Courtroom psychiatrist Dr. Bernard Diamond was called in and determined that Sirhan could only remember the assassination while under hypnosis, to which he proved highly susceptible. Through simple hypnotic suggestions, Diamond was able to get Sirhan to behave like a monkey and climb the bars of his cell. Sirhan immediately forgot about his actions and denied them when confronted.
<p>Sirhan learned self-hypnosis through a mail order course offered by <a href="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/what-is-monarch-mind-control-sirhan-sirhan-AMORC.jpg" title="Sirhan Sirhan, AMORC membership" rel="lightbox">AMORC</a>, a modern Rosicrucian group. Sirhan used techniques such as automatic writing to induce himself into a trance. It is during one of these sessions that he infamously scribbled “<a href="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/what-is-monarch-mind-control-sirhan-sirhan-rfk-must-die.jpg" title="Sirhan Sirhan, RFK Must Die" rel="lightbox">RFK must die</a>” repeatedly in his notebook.

<p>Sirhan’s lawyer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Teeter">Lawrence Teeter</a>, believed that his client was a Manchurian Candidate and <a href="http://www.ebonyshowcase.org/reopenrfkassassinationcase/#.WAvxYtB97C0">suggested the techniques used</a> in the CIA’s MKULTRA program and Operation ARTICHOKE were employed in the assassination of Kennedy.</p>

<p>In addition to the experiments detailed above, other subprojects are named in relation to Project MONARCH.  One eager Listserv poster avers to have identified Project Monarch as MKULTRA Subproject 84. There <a href="http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/mkultra/MKULTRA1/DOC_0000017486/DOC_0000017486.pdf">are 59 pages available on Subproject 84</a>. It involved hypnosis, but from the information available, it doesn&#8217;t appear to be nearly as sophisticated as Project MONARCH. </p>
<p>At least 4 subprojects (#102, #103, #112, and #117) used children as subjects, but the projects were nowhere as nefarious as anything described by MONARCH victims.</p>
<h2>NO MENTION OF MONARCH</h2>

<p>Of course, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. This is especially true in the case of the CIA, who routinely obstruct, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/24/obituaries/24HELM.html">commit perjury</a>, and destroy evidence.</p>
<p>In 1973, Gottlieb, as Chief of the Office of Technical Service, and with the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol44no4/html/v44i4a07p_0021.htm">authorization of DCI Richard Helms</a>, ordered the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0005444812.pdf">destruction of all files</a> pertaining to mind control and behavior modification. They were the <a href="https://archive.org/details/DOC_0000017748">only two people with a complete knowledge of the program</a>. Fortunately for history, a FOIA request filed by researcher John Marks revealed a stash of overlooked documents kept at a financial services branch, given us only a glimpse at the government’s mind control experiments.</p>

<p>In addition to the destruction and withholding of evidence, the <a href="https://archive.org/stream/CiaCongressionalHearingsOnHumanDrugTesting/CiaCongressionalHearingsOnSecretChemicalsAndDrugs#page/n101/mode/2up">CIA admitted using a cover filling system</a>. They prepared two sets of files. In one, the actual project goals and methods were described. Another, fake document, was prepared to be signed off on and officially circulated and filed.

<p>Author John DeCamp and William Colby, Director of the CIA in the 70’s, were close friends.

<p>&#8216;Monarch&#8217; was merely a name that some participants in the program-who knew very little about it, other than from their own limited participation-were given to identify themselves. But, as far as the CIA was concerned, there was no such program named &#8216;Monarch.&#8217;&#8230;”</p>

<p>There is also an abundance of information on government research into behavior modification still unexplored. BLUEBIRD, ARTICHOKE, and MKULTRA are but the tip of the iceberg. In the conclusion of The Search for the Manchurian Candidate, noted that there were 130 boxes of documents pertaining to behavior modification after MKULTRA was renamed and transferred in 1962 to the Office of Research and Development (ORD) led by Dr. Stephen Aldrich. </p>
<p>As of yet, no researcher has taken on the costs or efforts necessary to bring this information to light. </p>
<p>MKULTRA is a proven, acknowledged, government conspiracy. Project MONARCH is a lot more speculative. Confirmation of MKULTRA does not necessarily mean that every claim made by alleged victims of Project MONARCH is true. The void left by the destruction of MKULTRA documents, the obstruction, and the lying, was filled with endless speculation and increasingly outrageous conspiracy theories, giving rise to the MONARCH legend&#8230;</p>
<h1>Rise of the MONARCH Legend</h1>
<p>Monarch mind control theories combines Satanic ritual abuse, Bible prophecies of the Antichrist, Nazi death camp experiments, and legends of the illuminati and the New World Order into a new demonic mash-up of pure Evil. </p>
<h2>Origins: The Satanic Panic</h2>
<p>The Legend of Monarch followed on the heels of the Satanic panic which swept through much of the United States during the 1980s following the publication of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Remembers">Michelle Remembers</a>. The book became a bestseller and popularized the idea of widespread Satanic ritual abuse.  Michelle described being tortured, locked in cages, sexually abused, and forced to participate in Satanic blood rituals where infants were sacrificed.  These would become familiar motifs among later Monarch survivor testimonies.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMartin_preschool_trial">McMartin Preschool Abuse Trial</a> gained national attention after it surfaced that hundreds of children had participated in sex orgies and Satanic rituals. The ensuing hysteria lead to the closure of more than a hundred preschools. In the end of the <a href="http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/mcmartin/mcmartin.html">longest and most expensive criminal trial</a> in the history of the United States, all charges were dropped.</p>
<p>The case exposed some of the weaknesses of recovered memory therapy and how eager therapists could <a href="https://youtu.be/HxdxXVx2wdk?t=8m41s">easily coerce patients</a> and implant false memories during sessions. Therapists watching the trial adjusted their methods and became more careful about leading through suggestions.</p>
<p>The FBI also investigated allegations of the existence of a large, organized network of Satanists coordinating in the kidnapping, ritual sacrifice, and disposal of children.  <a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/136592NCJRS.pdf">They concluded that</a> <em>“There is little or no evidence for the portion of their allegations that deals with large-scale baby breeding, human sacrifice, and organized satanic conspiracies.”</em> </p>

Despite setting a record for the most watched 2-hour documentary on NBC, the <a href="http://io9.gizmodo.com/5829171/when-geraldo-rivera-took-on-satanism-and-a-very-confused-ozzy-osbourne">network still took a loss</a> because advertisers did not want to be connected with the show. </p>
<p>A group of McMartin Preschool parents appeared on the show via satellite, disgruntled and seemingly appalled that people would not believe their children’s claims of participating in orgies at car washes, circuses, and public airports; being flushed down toilets into secret rooms; travelling through elaborate network of <a href="http://mds.marshall.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1006&#038;context=psychology_faculty">non-existing underground tunnels</a> and flying in hot-air balloons; being attacked by lions; digging up coffins in cemeteries at night so that teachers could hack corpses to pieces; and being abused by Chuck Norris as witches flew by on broomsticks.</p>
<p>Seriously, you’ve never seen a group of parents so disappointed that their children <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2005/oct/30/magazine/tm-mcmartin44">had not participated</a> in sex orgies and Satanic rituals.</p>
<p>Geraldo interviewed therapists who reported being intimidated and receiving death threats for treating victims and exposing Satanic ritual abuse.  One of the therapist appearing on the show was <strong>Dr. Corydon Hammond</strong>, Professor at the <a href="http://medicine.utah.edu/faculty/mddetail.php?facultyID=u0032313">University of Utah School of Medicine</a>.</p>
<p>Four years later, the professor would give a speech that would influence hundreds and eventually thousands of therapists treating victims of Satanic Ritual Abuse.</p>
<h2>The Greenbaum Speech: Enter the Monarch</h2>
<p>Dr. Hammond spoke at a gathering of therapists held at the Radisson Hotel Plaza in Alexandria, Virginia in the summer of 1992. His lecture, entitled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FUersarZuo">Hypnosis in MPD: Ritual Abuse</a>, popularly known as “The Greenbaum Speech” described the epidemic of ritual abuse sweeping the United States.  Hammond has a solid reputation as a psychotherapist and hypnosis expert and hundreds of therapists attended the conference.</p>
<figure id="attachment_16474" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-16474" style="width: 197px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img src="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/what-is-monarch-mind-control-Corydon-Hammond.jpg" alt="Corydon Hammond" width="197" height="183" class="size-full wp-image-16474" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-16474" class="wp-caption-text">Corydon Hammond</figcaption></figure>This is the same claim he had <a href="https://youtu.be/EcWbuBPNtPw?t=1h18m08s">made on Geraldo years earlier</a>, except he added a twist… not only was ritual abuse real, it was used by a secretive worldwide network of Satanists intent on building a robotic army of Manchurian Candidates who did assassinations, prostitution, child porn, snuff films, drug smuggling, as well as international arm dealing in order to create a Satanic order ruling the world.</p>
<p>Of note for readers of this article, Hammond specifically mentions Project MONARCH which he described as a US government intelligence black program. The speech marks the earliest documented reference to Monarch. He also mentioned <a href="https://youtu.be/9FUersarZuo?t=1h21m6s">the Illuminati</a>.</p>
<p>Hammond received this information two and half year before giving his speech. He has confirmed much of it though consultation with his clients. Although Hammond doesn’t name his source, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/">conspiratards</a> Cathy O’Brien and Mark Phillips were beginning to speak out and distributing “proof” of their experience around this time, (More on the dynamic duo below) making them likely candidates as his sources. </p>
<p>Hammond publicized many of the elements that would later become staples of Monarch mind control survivor testimonies. </p>
<p>He talked on how infants are taken at around two and half year old and are made dissociative through sexual and physical torture. Five years later, the abuse is kicked up a notch until the end of their teenage years and reinforced periodically on adults. ‘Bloodliners’, children coming multiple generations of ritual abuse, are precious to the program.</p>
<p>Code words and secret signals are used to activate personalities.  Delta codes to activate an assassin; Beta codes for sex.</p>
<figure id="attachment_16476" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-16476" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img src="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/what-is-monarch-mind-control-zoolander.jpg" alt="Zoolander, 2001 Paramount Picutres" width="250" height="125" class="size-full wp-image-16476" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-16476" class="wp-caption-text">Zoolander, 2001 Paramount Picutres</figcaption></figure>He laid out the different levels of programming, including the Greek letter programs listed above. He also revealed how to access different programs, and more importantly for therapists in the room, he detailed how to deprogram mind control victims.  He determined that between half to two thirds of ritually abused patients had some sort of mind control programming. Thus linking Satanic ritual abuse with the government’s mind control research.</p>
<p>Hammond named Dr. Green (aka Greene or Greenbaum) as one of the key players in the government’s mind control program. Green was raised in Germany as a Hasidic Jew and taken to a concentration camp once the Nazis took power. The Nazi scientists took a liking to him and he began helping them in experiments.  He came over to work in the US with other Nazi scientists under Paperclip and studied medicine on Uncle Sam’s dime. His experience made him a valuable mind control researcher and he designed and supervised many of the programs.</p>
<p>Dr. Green’s backstory would change dramatically in the future.</p>
<p>The professor’s lecture was very well received, ending with a standing ovation. One of the therapists attending the conference was New Orleans therapist <strong>Valerie Wolf</strong>. Although, she herself didn’t attend Hammond’s lecture, she soon heard about it from a colleague who had, and immediately got an audio recording of the lecture.</p>
<h2>Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments</h2>
<p>Back home, Valerie Wolf discovered that two of her ritually abused victims had also been subjected to mind-control using Hammond’s techniques. On March 15, 1995, Wolf, and her clients, Chris DeNicola Ebner and Claudia Mullen <a href="https://youtu.be/GCdAsuxzf5c">testified before the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments</a>. </p>

<p>A man she knew as Dr. Green used radiation, electroshocks, hypnosis, as well as drugs to induce traumas. She learned espionage tradecraft, including how to pick locks, “being secretive”,  and memory techniques enabling her to develop a photographic memory.  Despite this training, they kept her in a cage near Dr. Green’s office. She would often escape and sneak into his office photographically memorizing entire files, <a href="http://whale.to/b/sp/springmeier.html#Program Codes During 1972-1976 for Dr. Green">including trigger codewords</a>, CIA and military correspondence, as well as project names (cryptonyms) and subproject numbers. </p>
<p>After nearly a decade, DeNicola proved a poor subject matter for assassination training, Dr. Green attempted to trigger her self-destruct programming. </p>

As a result, she offers a lot more insider knowledge of the program than DeNicola. Mullen was used a child and all through in her teens in sexual entrapment schemes to blackmail powerful politicians. The CIA had figured out that video footage of anyone having sex with an underage child was the surest method to get anyone to do what the Agency wanted.</p>
<p>Mullen testified to being subjected to radiation, hypnosis, electroshocks, sleep deprivation, isolation, brainwashing, as well as physical and sexual abuse in order to create multiple personalities and make her into a perfect spy. Mullen eventually developed over 100 individual personalities, mostly girls aged 1 to 16.</p>
<p>At the age of 8, she was recruited by the CIA and met Sidney Gottlieb, who she knew as Uncle Syd. She received training at the Agency’s Deep Creek Cabins in Maryland on sexually pleasing and coaxing information out of older men before being used in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Midnight_Climax">Project Midnight Climax</a>-type honey pot operations to extract information or blackmail powerful and influential people, be it friend or foe. The CIA wished to maintained a continuous source of funding for its mind control experiments.</p>
<p>In addition to Gottlieb, Mullen personally met pretty much anyone connected to the CIA’s MKULTRA program; Richard Helms, Allan Dulles, John Gittinger, Ewan Cameron, George White, Morse Allen, and Martin Horne. This is a veritable who’s who of the government’s research into mind control. Her therapist claimed that Mullen couldn’t have known this level of details without actually being there or filing FOIA request herself, which Mullen hadn’t. </p>

Most (if not all) of Mullen’s revelation are found in this single volume.</p>
<p>Gottlieb’s idiosyncrasies described by Mullen, such as his limp, his Scottish accent, and his raising of goats are all in Mark’s book. The places she names, like where she received training (Deep Creek Cabins) is most likely inspired by Deep Creek Lodge, where Frank Olson was infamously slipped LSD by Gottlieb, days before plunging to his death. Marks dedicates a whole chapter to <a href="http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/lsd/marks5.htm">the death of Frank Olson</a>. </p>
<p>Her description of the New Orleans safe house is <a href=" http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/lsd/marks6.htm">remarkably similar</a> to Mark&#8217;s, including the 2-way mirror and even the toilet on which George White sat observing. Her description of Cameron’s psychic driving? Again, <a href="http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/lsd/marks8.htm">uncanny</a>.</p>
<p>Mullen admitted that the only radiation she had been subjected to was in the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20051124175624/http://mindcontrolforums.com/radio/ckln07.htm">form of X-rays</a> for regular health check-ups, not for torture or mind control purposes. <a href="http://whale.to/b/wolf3.html#Mullen2">Her testimony</a> about radiation being used in mind control is hearsay. </p>
<p>Despite my suspicions regarding Claudia Mullen’s claims, hers and Ms. DeNicola’s testimonies are relatively tame when compared with later statements made by alleged Monarch victims, Cathy O’Brien, Cisco Wheeler, and Brice Taylor. (see below)</p>
<p>Unlike the Monarch victims, there are no mentions of the Illuminati, no Bible prophecies of the Anti-Christ, no celebrities, and none were privy to the elite’s plans for a New World Order. There are no mention of Project MONARCH. Additionally, there were no financial motives; no lecture tours, no book or movie deals.</p>
<p>Mullen and DeNicola’s memories were not recovered through hypnosis. It is a lot less likely that suggestion or coaxing was involved.  Their therapist Valerie Wolf <a href="http://members.tranquility.net/~rwinkel/CKLN/HTML/transc11.htm">had learned better from following the McMartin Trial</a>.</p>
<p>Wolf does not jump to conclusions and considers it her job to believe her clients. She theorizes that Satanic rituals were used by researchers as covers for their experiments.</p>
<p>Ms. Mullen’s testimony and comments made in an <a href="http://members.tranquility.net/~rwinkel/CKLN/MP3/15B.MP3">interview with Wayne Morris</a> helped track down the identification of the mysterious Dr. Green&#8230;</p>

<h2>Dr. Green Identified</h2>
<p>Mullen <a href="http://members.tranquility.net/~rwinkel/CKLN/MP3/15B.MP3">added a significant amount of details</a> to the Greenbaum legend. <em>(7:00)</em> She remembers his name tag as <strong>L.

In personal conversations, he revealed that his name was <strong>Liam</strong>, that he was Jewish, and that had been raised in a German concentration camp where he collaborated with the Nazis and conducted experiments with his hero, <strong>Dr. Josef Mengele</strong>.</p>

He told me, when I was about fourteen or fifteen, he told one of my shadows [alters] the story &#8230; how he got involved. </p>
<p>He said he was Jewish, and he was in a concentration camp when the war ended and the Nazis had killed his sister and put him in a concentration camp.

<p>This information allowed researcher <a href="https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Jo%C3%ABl_van_der_Reijden">Joël van der Reijden</a> to draw the pieces together &#8211; he was able to <a href="https://isgp-studies.com/2009_11_In_brief_beyond_Dutroux_ties_to_US_CIA">identify Luther Wilson Greene</a>, Scientific Director of the Chemical Corps Technical Command at Edgewood Arsenal in the 40s and 50s. Greene was surrounded by Paperclip Nazis but probably never set foot in a concentration camp.

<p>The Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments were given access to still-classified documents and looked into the claims that radiation had been used in the CIA’s mind control experiments. They found that the Agency had initially expressed an <a href="https://archive.org/stream/DOC_0000017748#page/n5/mode/2up">interest in early documents</a>, but that it never panned out into experiments or for operational use. The committee made <strong>Recommendation 18</strong>, in which they urged the CIA to increase transparency and suggested more declassification of files related to mind control to reinstate public trust.</p>
<blockquote class="emphasis"><p>“So long as documents about secret human experiments are withheld from the public, it will be impossible to put to rest distrust with the conduct of governments.

</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, DeNicola and Mullen&#8217;s testimonies opened the floodgates. And things were about to get A WHOLE LOT wilder….</p>
<h2>MONARCH Madness &#8211; The Monarch Women</h2>
<p>There are significant differences between the testimonies given by victims of MKULTRA, DeNicola and Mullen’s, and those given by Monarch victim survivors.  </p>
<p>Monarch victim all occupied an exalted position within Project Monarch. They are often Presidential Models who have sex with US Presidents and other world leaders, significantly upgrading the cast of characters with A-list politicos and celebrities.</p>
<p>Dr. Green or Greenbaum, the previously-mentioned young Jewish doctor morphs into none other that the Angel of Death himself, Joseph Mengele, gallivanting around US military facilities and Disney theme parks, SS uniform and all. </p>
<p>Also, for people with supposedly photographic memories, they are all equally terrible at demonstrating their abilities. In fact, none have ever publicly demonstrated any of their supposed skills, be it combat skills or even lock picking.</p>
<p>Although they are not the only whistleblowers to have come forward, I will mainly focus on Cathy O’Brien, Cisco Wheeler, and Brice Taylor. These MONARCHian Candidates’ tale of enslavement and miraculous escape from MONARCH captivity have spawned multiple books, interviews, lectures, and forum discussions and has significantly shaped the MONARCH legend. I will only give a brief account of each.</p>
<p>Each subsequent victim-survivor tell-all book adds more embellishments, more famous names, expanding the Monarch myth even further. As proof we are told that Dick Cheney is well-endowed, while senator Byrd, less so. Unverifiable claims, and even is Cheney decided to tweet his junk, not specific enough to mean anything.</p>
<p>Many conspiracy observers consider these stories far fetched and usually discount them as either government disinformation, or worst, attention seekers and con artists out to make a buck. </p>
<p>The most prominent of these women are:</p>
<h2>Cathy O’Brien</h2>
<figure id="attachment_16483" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-16483" style="width: 197px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img src="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/what-is-monarch-mind-control-cathy-obrien.jpg" alt="Cathy O’Brien" width="197" height="196" class="size-full wp-image-16483" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-16483" class="wp-caption-text">Cathy O’Brien</figcaption></figure>Cathy O’Brien (Cathleen Ann O&#8217;Brien) was the <a href="https://youtu.be/FvEBmEo4IA0">first victim of trauma-based mind control</a> to specifically mention <strong>Project MONARCH</strong>, a CIA program in which dissociative personalities were programmed to perform various tasks such as espionage, drug smuggling, message delivery, and prostitution. They work in conjunction with an international pedophile ring, drug kingpins, and Satanists. She is the most prominent victims of Project Monarch. (At the time of this writing, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Monarch">wiki entry</a> for Project Monarch redirects to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_O%27Brien_(conspiracy_theorist)">hers</a>.)</p>
<p>O&#8217;Brien was physically and sexually abused by her father and uncles from the time of her birth in 1957. After being caught producing and distributing child pornography through the post (starring Cathy and Buster, the family pet) in 1964, her father sold her to the CIA in return for being let off the hook. The Agency was looking for subjects from multigenerational incestual families for their Top Secret Project Monarch program. Her father went to Harvard for a 2-week crash course on raising (i.e. traumatizing) Monarch children.</p>
<p>Cathy received Wizard of Oz Programming, developed a photographic memory (never demonstrated),and increased her visual acuity 44 times.(never demonstrated)  She made two instructional videos for mind control programmers at NASA, <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f610.png" alt="😐" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>How to Divide a Personality</strong> and <strong>How to Create a Sex Slave</strong>. </p>
<p>Her sexuality was “enhanced” and she was judged suitable to become a Presidential Model, highly-prized prostitutes and messenger for the word’s most powerful people. Her first handler was Gerald Ford, but many people had the “keys to the kingdom”, that is, knew the trigger codes to access her sexual personalities, including Senator Vander Jagt, Senator Byrd, Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, Dick Cheney, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Manuel Noriega, Saudi King Fahd, George HW Bush, Baby Duc Duvalier, as well as numerous country music entertainers and pro-baseball players.</p>

The couple fled to Alaska, where Philips, an “<a href="http://www.trance-formation.com/">internationally recognized expert in mind control and deprogramming</a>”, (he isn’t) began the arduous task of deprogramming her. </p>
<p>Phillips loves to insinuate that he was a CIA or DIA contractor, but has the appearance and demeanor of a used-car salesmen. Philips often makes wild and unsubstantiated claims, such as the existence of an Above Top Secret government laboratory under a lake at Disney World, which <a href="https://youtu.be/TMrd56B-ok0?t=1h36m44s">he contends is declassified information</a>. He also claimed to have used a machine that would cause people entering his house to <a href="https://youtu.be/Nir9mOWkj5c?t=58m19s">instantly forget what they were doing</a>. Intruders would just stay there and would die of thirst if he didn&#8217;t go home for a while. He knows because he&#8217;s tested it on his neighbors! </p>
<p>Phillips is without a doubt one of the most transparent bullsh!tter out there. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f47f.png" alt="👿" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Philips also claims to have seen Project MONARCH documents while doing contract work for NASA in the 60s or 70s. Alternatively, he admitted making up the Project MONARCH cryptonym <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010413003604/http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Shadowlands/6583/project123.html">to see who would pick it up</a>.</p>

(some <a href="https://forum.davidicke.com/showpost.php?s=bf933c12a3eaa6a78b805e9c3b5f4da6&#038;p=211495&#038;postcount=15">fans are convinced</a> that she <u><strong>did</strong></u> testify to Congress) When a FOIA request filed with the CIA for Cathy’s name <a href="https://archive.org/stream/CathyOBrienMarkPhilipsTranceFormationOfAmericaMKULTRA1995/Cathy_OBrien__Mark_Philips_-_Trance_Formation_of_America_MKULTRA_-_1995#page/n55/mode/2up">returned no hits</a>, it further convinced them of the government&#8217;s duplicity. Undeterred, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folie_%C3%A0_deux">the couple</a> collected their testimony and made it into a book, <a href="https://archive.org/details/CathyOBrienMarkPhilipsTranceFormationOfAmericaMKULTRA1995">Trance: Formation of America</a> (1995) which they self-published in order to maintain the integrity of its content. It’s much more likely that no mainstream publisher would touch this due to possible nightmarish litigation.</p>
<p>Through “the Strength of the Human Spirit”, O’Brien is now a “<a href="http://trance-formation.com/torture.htm">fully rehabilitated US Government White House/Pentagon level mind control survivor.</a>” The couple have recently taken <a href="https://youtu.be/Nir9mOWkj5c">another alleged survivor</a> under their wings, to the dismay of <a href="https://youtu.be/CIUy2DtxmnA">the unfortunate girl’s family</a>. (discussed <a href="http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message2931364/pg1">here</a>)</p>
<p>Besides her own testimony, O’Brien offers no proof that she was a victim of a government-sponsored mind control program. Despite having a photographic memory, she is unable to provide dates or locations where her information could be collaborated.  Her understanding of world events and New World Order machinations are infantile and <a href="http://www.illuminatirex.com/history-new-world-order/">cartoonish</a> <img src="https://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/mrgreen.png" alt=":mrgreen:" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> and offer no further insights which cannot be found in conspiracy literature.</p>
<p>She provided proof of mutilation in footage shot for a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040406045357/www.guerrillanews.com/tmdg_trailer/treat_2.html">proposed HBO documentar</a>y entitled <a href="https://youtu.be/Laon3_ob54A">The Most Dangerous Game</a>. Unfortunately, it’s impossible to determine if her ventriloquist ex-husband Alex Houston actually performed the mutilation under the direction of <a href="http://disinfo.com/2013/09/devils-advocate-interview-dr-michael-aquino/" class="broken_link">Michael Aquino</a> for the perversions of Senator Byrd as she claims. It does however, offer evidence that she was subjected to abuse in the past. It is possible that both her and her daughter Kelly <a href="https://archive.org/stream/CathyOBrienMarkPhilipsTranceFormationOfAmericaMKULTRA1995/Cathy_OBrien__Mark_Philips_-_Trance_Formation_of_America_MKULTRA_-_1995#page/n45/mode/2up">were members of a cult</a>. Cults are undoubtedly using mind control techniques on members.</p>
<h2>Cisco Wheeler</h2>
<figure id="attachment_16490" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-16490" style="width: 197px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img src="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/what-is-monarch-mind-control-cisco-wheeler.jpg" alt="Cisco Wheeler" width="197" height="196" class="size-full wp-image-16490" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-16490" class="wp-caption-text">Cisco Wheeler (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161003012355/http://ageoftruth.dk:80/cisco-wheeler/">image source</a>)</figcaption></figure>Cisco Wheeler (Linda Johnson, Linda Anderson) was born into one of the multi-generational <a href="http://www.illuminatirex.com/illuminati-bloodlines/">Satanic families of the Illuminati</a>. She was subjected to trauma while still in her mother&#8217;s womb and became a subject of the CIA’s Project MONARCH who in addition to the usual spy/courier/prostitute training wished to turn her into one of three Mothers of Darkness, women destined to become brides of Lucifer. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f62f.png" alt="😯" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Like O’Brien, Cisco was abused by her own father who was also her handler and programmer from 1947 well into the 60s. Her father, known as Dr. Black, worked directly under the previously mentioned Dr. Green who was Cisco’s primary programmer. She identifies Dr. Green as none other than <strong>Josef Mengele</strong>, the Angel of Death himself. Mengele, an Illuminati Grand Master was the project’s <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/mindcontrol/chapter01.htm">lead programmer and original designer</a>. He would say things like “<a href="https://archive.org/stream/Volume1TheyKnowNotWhatTheyDo_201604/Volume%201-%20They%20Know%20Not%20What%20They%20Do#page/n31/mode/2up" class="broken_link">Dance marionette, dance!</a>” (I kid you not <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f644.png" alt="🙄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ) </p>
<p>They used trauma as well as films such as Fantasia, Alice in Wonderland, and Wizard of Oz to split her mind into individual programmable alters. Sometimes, demons would take human form and perform the programming. The demons themselves were also inserted into victims to protect the programming. Scary stuff. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f615.png" alt="😕" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>
<p>She has Beta (sex kitten) and Delta (assassin) espionage alters which she used to blackmail people into submission to the Illuminati. She was sexually servicing US President as far back as Dwight Eisenhower and did missions for the Kennedys but was never herself a Presidential Model. She was a master programmer and remember instructing Mark Phillips. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f62f.png" alt="😯" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Illuminati-wise, she was aligned with the British Royals faction. All Monarchs receive end-time programming which is set to trigger when the Antichrist arrives. </p>
<p>Her programming began breaking down following the death of her father. Once again, another self-proclaimed mind control expert, Fritz Springmeier, was willing to neglect his family to undertake the deprogramming of Wheeler.</p>
<p>They wrote 3 books together. <a href="https://archive.org/details/Volume1TheyKnowNotWhatTheyDo_201604" class="broken_link">They Know Not What They Do, An Illustrated Guide to Monarch Programming-Mind Control</a> in 1995, <a href="https://archive.org/details/Volume2_201604" class="broken_link">The Illuminati Formula Used to Create an Undetectable Total Mind Controlled Slave</a> in 1996 and <a href="https://archive.org/details/pdfy-r4h3bvzSoE3Ln9Y7">Deeper Insights into the Illuminati Formula</a> in 1997.

<p>They describe MONARCH as a “<a href="http://whale.to/b/sp/spr13.html">specific project carried out in secret by the U.S. government and intelligence groups</a>” and avers that although at least 2 million Americans have been victims of trauma-based mind control, only about 40,000 are actively monitored Monarch slaves. Volume 2 offers a step-by-step recipe for making a Monarch Mind-Controlled slave: 1. In Utero traumatization 2. Induced premature birth 3. Love Bombing until 18 months old 4. Fracturing the Mind.</p>
<p>Predictively, many of their claims are quite out there. Namely, <a href="https://archive.org/stream/Volume1TheyKnowNotWhatTheyDo_201604/Volume%201-%20They%20Know%20Not%20What%20They%20Do#page/n45/mode/2up/" class="broken_link">Al Gore is a vampire</a> who always carries blood in a briefcase in case he needs a snack. Jesuits provide thousands of babies who are <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/mindcontrol/chapter02.htm">imprisoned in tiny cages in large airplane hangars</a> at China Lake Naval Base and subjected to Monarch mind control programming.</p>
<p>Of course, Wheeler and Springmeier furnish no evidence <a href="http://whale.to/b/sp/spr13.html#INTRODUCTION by Fritz">or even sources</a> for any of this. Zero. Zilch.</p>

<h2>Brice Taylor</h2>
<figure id="attachment_16491" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-16491" style="width: 197px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img src="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/what-is-monarch-mind-control-brice-taylor.jpg" alt="Brice Taylor" width="197" height="196" class="size-full wp-image-16491" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-16491" class="wp-caption-text">Brice Taylor</figcaption></figure>Brice Taylor (Sue Ford) was a high-level Monarch mind control sex slave and human filing cabinet. She was a Presidential Model sex slave, spy, as well as a courier between world leaders.</p>
<p>Taylor was sexually and physically abused soon after her birth by her father and grandfather in a shack located behind the family home. She began doing child porn at the age of 2 and participated in torturous rituals and sexual orgies. Her father used Wizard of Oz and Disney films to program her. She would forget everything when she heard “There’s no place like home.” She was also used to kidnap other children who were lured into black cars then used in porn or rituals and killed off. </p>
<p>At the age of 5, her father took her to a slave auction where she was sold to comedian Bob Hope. She received high-level Beta programming at US military bases and NASA and trained as a Presidential Model. Taylor sexualy serviced every US president from John Kennedy to Bill Clinton as well as government officials, foreign dignitaries, world leaders, mobsters, and Hollywood celebrities. She would wear a blue butterfly pin or earrings to signal insiders.</p>
<p>She was impregnated twice a year and the fetuses were used in sacrificial ceremonies. Like O’Brien, she named her daughter Kelly. This was done so that pedophile George HW Bush could easier to remember the names of his ”Bush Babies”. </p>
<p>She carried messages for the Council, an Illuminati-like cabal in control of the entire planet, and was made privy to their future plans. She was flown by helicopter to ships, hotels, and private islands to deliver messages. An excellent swimmer, she sometimes had to use her “dolphin programming” to swim out to yachts waiting in international waters, the preferred meeting place for Council members. </p>
<p>Henry Kissinger used her photographic memory as a mind file. He could add any information he wished and retrieve it whenever he desired. She had top clearance at the Pentagon, the State Department, and at the Federal Reserve.</p>
<figure id="attachment_16485" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-16485" style="width: 200px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img src="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/what-is-monarch-mind-control-brice-taylor-thanks-for-the-memories.jpg" alt="Thanks for the Memories" width="200" height="258" class="size-full wp-image-16485" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-16485" class="wp-caption-text">Thanks for the Memories (1999)<br />
(<a href="https://archive.org/details/BriceTaylorThanksForTheMemoriesWITHPICTURESLARGEFONT" class="broken_link">Read Now</a> | <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0966891627/illuminatirex-20" class="broken_link">Buy</a>)</figcaption></figure>Brice began remembering her memories at the age of 35. She initially thought she had been sexually abused in rituals but in 1986, realized that she had been part of the government’s Top Secret Project MONARCH, a CIA white slavery operation connected to MKULTRA. Sensing danger for her family she left them in April of 1991 and fled to Hawaii. Fortunately, she did not flee into the arms of an self-proclaimed deprogramming expert, but began deprogramming herself. She wrote her first book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0006F6HEW/illuminatirex-20" class="broken_link">Starshine: One woman&#8217;s valiant escape from mind control: a novel</a>, a fictionalized account of her life.</p>
<p>She lived with Cathy O’Brien and Mark Phillips for a year and half, but the relationship <a href="http://educate-yourself.org/mc/markphillipstruestory12jul00.shtml">ended on a sour note</a> after Phillips told her she had never been a victim of mind control and had imagined the whole thing. In 1999, she published <a href="https://archive.org/details/BriceTaylorThanksForTheMemoriesWITHPICTURESLARGEFONT" class="broken_link">Thanks for the Memories</a>, in which she tells her experience as a government mind control sex slave and human filing cabinet.</p>
<p>Like other MONARCH survivors, she routinely mingled with Hollywood celebrities. Frank Sinatra confided in her that he had ordered the hit on Elvis. Sylvester Stallone loved dolphin porn and directed Taylor and her daughter Kelly performing underwater ballet while having sex with dolphins and sea turtles. She reports that the sea turtles weren&#8217;t into it. </p>
<p>Taylor felt nauseous after recalling a one week affair with Prince Charles.</p>
<h2>Other Monarchs</h2>
<p>Other alleged MONARCH mind control victim have come forward. Most notably, <strong>Arizona Wilder</strong>, in a 1999 David Icke interview entitled <a href="https://youtu.be/p62cTYszOFg">Revelations of a Mother Goddess</a>. She was subjected to programming and forced to participate in rituals where she summoned and channeled interdimensional Reptilian aliens for the Illuminati. She started recovering her memories after the death of Josef Mengele in 1979, who she also identifies as Dr. Green or Dr. Greenbaum.</p>
<p>Arizona Wilder (Jennifer Ann Kealey) gained a lot of exposure following her Icke interview and I have listed her as one the <a href="http://www.illuminatirex.com/illuminati-whistleblowers/#wilder">top 10 Illuminati whistleblowers</a>.</p>
<p>Victoria Vulpes is another alleged victim interviewed by Walter Bowart in <a href="https://archive.org/details/OperationMindControlResearchersEdition">Operation Mind Control</a>. Like others, she was involved in an incestuous relationship with her father and forced to participate in Satanic rituals where she witnessed blood sacrifices of infants. She claims that she was <a href="https://archive.org/stream/OperationMindControlResearchersEdition/Operation%20Mind%20Control%20-%20Researcher%27s%20Edition#page/n205/mode/2up">inoculated against for HIV in 1968</a>. This is a verifiable claim which an immunologist could use to rid the world of AIDS.  But, no. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Another victim, Kathleen Sullivan wrote <a href="https://archive.org/details/2003SullivanUnshackledASurvivorsStoryOfMindControl" class="broken_link">Unshackled</a>, detailing her experience as a survivor of Monarch mind control. Sullivan has <a href="https://youtu.be/_eGyjZ1sGW0">appeared in some interviews</a> alongside Brice Taylor. She is no friend of Phillips or O’Brien either. She is interviewed <a href="http://members.tranquility.net/~rwinkel/CKLN/HTML2/transc17.htm">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There is no doubt that the US government used drugs, radiation, sleep deprivation, electroshocks, and other forms of torture on unsuspecting Americans.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the women outlined in this article have actually suffered abuse in the past. </p>
<p>There is no doubt that the victims themselves believe to be telling the truth. However, their stories improbabilities and exaggerations make them unlikely to be true. At least, not how they’ve described them.  Regardless, <strong>be it intentional disinformation or unintentional misinformation</strong>, they are most likely doing disservice to actual victims of mind control.</p>
<p>Therapist Valerie Wolf point that scenarios such as Satanic rituals could have been deliberately used by Dr. Green, Dr. Orne, and other CIA doctors as <a href="http://members.tranquility.net/~rwinkel/CKLN/HTML/transc11.htm">covers for their experiments</a> bears a second mention as it would explain a lot of inconsistencies in survivor testimonies. The same has been <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_mindcon04.htm">theorized about UFO abductions</a>. The elaborate charades would serve two purposes. </p>
<p>Firstly, it would make the victim appear crazy to almost anyone they confess to. </p>
<p>Secondly, it would waste a lot of a therapist’s time and help dissimulate signs of being mind controlled if the victim ever remembered and sought out therapy.</p>
<p>Would the government commit atrocities attributed to government-sponsored ritual abuse? <strong>Yes</strong>.</p>
<p>Would the government torture children and used them as poisoned honey pots in blackmail operations? Possibly, especially when governments consider it a necessity to maintaining their power. </p>

<div class="tabcontent">

<p>The Order of the Illuminati loves to taunt “The Profane” by placing their sacred symbols in plain sight.</p>
<p>Their symbols are all around us.     They’re part of our landscape&#8230;<br />
They’re even on our money.<br />
Corporate logos&#8230;<br />
They appear throughout pop culture from music&#8230;<br />
&#8230;to movies and televisions.<br />
… and even children’s cartoons&#8230;.</p>
<p>Only Illuminati insiders know the symbols’ true meaning. </p>
<p>In the book Morals and Dogma, Sovereign Grand Commander of the Scottish Rite and thirty-third degree Freemason Albert Pike wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“Masonry, like all the Religions, all the Mysteries, Hermeticism and Alchemy, conceals its secrets from all except the Adepts and Sages, or the Elect, and uses false explanations and misinterpretations of its symbols to mislead those who deserve only to be misled; to conceal the Truth, which it calls Light, from them, and to draw them away from it.” </p></blockquote>
<p>In order to know how deeply these symbols are embedded all around you, you must first know what the symbols are&#8230;and what they means.</p>
<p>Here are the top ten most popular symbols used by the Illuminati:</p>
<h2>Number 10: The skull</h2>
<p>To Masons, the skull and crossbones is a memento mori, Latin for “remember that you must die&#8221;.     </p>
<p>The skull and bones is prominent on Master Mason trestle boards and is commonly featured on Masonic rings.</p>
<p>The Bavarian Illuminati used the skull in its 10th degree initiation ritual. </p>
<p>Illuminati Princes were shown a skeleton and asked if the bones were those of a king, a nobleman, or a beggar.</p>
<p>The symbol is the emblem and namesake of the elite Yale senior fraternity, Skull and Bones.</p>
<p>Skull and Bones existence entered the mainstream American consciousness during the 2004 US election when it was revealed that both Presidential candidates had been Bonesmen while attending Yale.</p>
<p>Inside the Skull and Bones headquarters, known as the Tomb, a painting of skulls features the 54“Wer war der Thor, wer Weiser, Bettler oder Kaiser? Ob Arm, ob Reich, im Tode gleich.” </p>
<p>Or “Who was the fool, who the wise man, beggar or king? Whether poor or rich, all’s the same in death.”</p>
<p>The Nazi SS resurrected the Totenkopf, or “dead’s head” symbol first used by Frederic the Great over a century before. </p>
<p>To Nazis, it represented the willingness to put your own life on the line for the sake of the community</p>
<p>The Knights Templar were charged with the crime of blasphemy for worshiping the severed head of Baphomet.</p>
<h2>Number 9: The Obelisk</h2>
<p>The obelisk is an ancient Egyptian phallic symbol that rather obviously represents power.  </p>
<p>They have been sought by conquerors and tyrants ever since Rome conquered Egypt and have been dispersed all over the world.</p>
<p>Obelisks are used by the Illuminati to mark major centers of power.</p>
<p>There is an obelisk marking the Illuminati’s spiritual center at St-Peter’s Square, </p>
<p>&#8230;another, 555 feet tall, on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., the Illuminati’s military wing.</p>
<p>&#8230;and obelisks In New York’s Central Park and in the City of London. , marking the Order’s financial centers.</p>
<h2>Number 8: Fire</h2>
<p>The Statue of Liberty with its famous Liberty Torch was donated to the United States by France thanks to funding efforts by French Freemasons. </p>
<p>Designer Frederic Bartholdi was a freemason, so was the statue’s architect Gustave Eiffel.  </p>
<p>The builder of the pedestal, Richard Hunt &#8211;  also a Freemason.</p>
<p>There is  smaller copy of Lady Liberty on an artificial island in the River Seine a short distance from the  Eiffel Tower. </p>
<p>The statue portrays Libertas holding up a torch, bringing enlightenment to the world.</p>
<p>Some believe that the statue represents Semiramis, the Queen Whore of Babylon…</p>
<p>&#8230;while others believe she represents the Bringer of Light, Lucifer. </p>
<p>Founder of the Bavarian Illuminati Adam Weishaupt, inspired by Zoroaster, prominently used the color red in the Order’s higher degrees.</p>
<p>The Olympic Torch relay was introduced by the Nazis at the 1936 Olympic Games.</p>
<p>Flames are found on the corporate logo for Columbia Pictures.</p>
<p>JD Rockefeller chose a flame for Standard Oil.</p>
<h2>Number 7: The butterfly</h2>
<p>Butterflies traditionally represent a metamorphosis &#8211; a significant or dramatic change.</p>
<p>To the Illuminati, it is code for Monarch Mind Control.</p>
<p>Monarch is a name given by the Illuminati to a secret government mind control program far surpassing the CIA’s MK-Ultra. </p>
<p>Monarch produces perfect mind controlled slaves who perform tasks for their handlers ranging from assassination and spying to fulfilling the sexual appetites of US Presidents and high government officials.</p>
<p>According to one researcher, over 2 million Americans are currently under mind-control.</p>
<p>It is that the Illuminati uses  movies such as Disney’s Fantasia and the Wizard of Oz to program mind control slaves.</p>
<p>Monarchs and their handlers use butterflies on stage and costumes, or incorporate them into artwork and logos.</p>
<p>Dramatic behavioral changes &#8211; shaving your head or instantly switching personalities in interviews &#8211; might indicate a breakdown in Monarch programming.</p>
<h2>Number 6: The snake</h2>
<p>Like the serpent in the Garden of Eden, snakes represent Evil.<br />
They are the guardians of forbidden knowledge, which explains its appeal to secret societies.</p>
<p>Celebrities with ties to the Illuminati frequently pose with snakes or use them in performance.</p>
<p>A statue of Draco guards the entrance to the City of London, the center of world finance and headquarters of the Rothschilds, the Illuminati’s top family.</p>
<p>It is said that Lucifer himself sits at the head of the Rothschild family table.</p>
<p>The logo for Italian car maker Alfa Romeo features a snake eating a human.  The symbol known as a Biscione is commonly used in heraldic shields.</p>
<p>The logo for Swedish defense company Saab features Satan’s serpent tongue.</p>
<p>Ouroboros, the snake swallowing its own tail and signifying eternity and regeneration, represents the Illuminati’s multi generational bloodlines.</p>
<p>David Icke and around 12 million Americans believe the use of the symbolic snake figures are evidence that the US government is controlled by Reptilian Aliens.</p>
<h2>Number 5 &#8211; the owl</h2>
<p>The owl is an occult symbol of wisdom and was a hallmark of the Bavarian Illuminati. </p>
<p>After a trial period of up to 3 years, Initiates rose to the Minerval class and gained access to those assemblies and academies.</p>
<p>Named after Minerva, the Roman name for the Greek goddess Pallas Athena, she was depicted on Illuminati medallions as an owl and represented wisdom and vigilance.</p>
<p>The Bohemian Grove, an exclusive campground located in the midst of giant Californian Redwood trees, uses the owl as its logo.</p>
<p>Every summer, global business and government elite meet at Bohemian Grove and offer mock sacrifices at their sinister Owl Shrine.</p>
<p>It was here that Ronald Reagan promised Richard Nixon that he would not oppose in the 1968 Republican primary.</p>
<p>The Manhattan Project was born in the Grove.</p>
<p>The owl is hidden on the US one dollar bill, </p>
<p>in celebrity tattoos and fashion.</p>
<p>And even in the architectural designs.</p>
<h2>Number 4: the pentagram</h2>
<p>The Sigil of Baphomet is usually depicted with two points up, indicating Satan’s horns.</p>
<p>The Devil’s Horns is also a popular hand sign made with the index and pinkie fingers. </p>
<p>Originally a charm to ward off, over time it came to be understood as a gesture invoking evil.<br />
The pentagram can be observed in the street layout of Washington D.C. designed by French Freemason Pierre Charles L’enfant </p>
<p>An inverted pentagram is the emblem of The Order of the Eastern Star, an organization for female relatives of Freemasons.</p>
<p>The pentagram is common in music videos<br />
mainstream movies,<br />
and children’s cartoons.</p>
<h2>Number 3:  the number of the beast</h2>
<p>666 designates the Anti-Christ as revealed in the Book of Revelation: </p>
<blockquote><p>“Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The Illuminati believe the Anti-Christ is destined to guide them to a New Word Order.</p>
<p>666 is found in every UPC barcode in the United States.</p>
<p>The number is hidden in the corporate logo of Taco Bell&#8230;</p>
<p>It’s concealed in the logos of Walt Disney Pictures, Monster energy Drink, and Google Chrome</p>
<p>And British telecom giant Vodafone, whose logo is remarkably similar to the KKK.</p>
<p>The Number of the Beast can also be represented using the hand gesture for Okay &#8211; by touching your thumb and your index fingers, creating a circle, while three fingers make the tails of three sixes.</p>
<p>Illuminati puppets and minions flash the symbol during their performances as a secret salute to the Anti-Christ.</p>
<h2>Number 2: The pyramid.</h2>
<p>This pyramid represents the top-down power structure of the Illuminati with the plutocrats commanding from the capstone and the peons at the bottom.</p>
<p>The Bavarian Illuminati used the pyramid, both capped, and uncapped, during its Minerval Assemblies.</p>
<p>The pyramid, representing the Illuminati itself, was painted on a carpet with scattered stone in front of it.</p>
<p>The stones represent the work still to be done for the glory of the Grand Architect.</p>
<p>The Bavarian Illuminati managed to infiltrate European masonry at the 1782 Congress of Wilhelmsbad.  The Landgrave of Hesse, who hosted the event, erected a pyramid on nearby grounds. </p>
<p>That same Landgrave later became Prince Charles of Hesse-Kassel, and the profits from renting out his Hessian mercenaries to fight American revolutionaries eventually gave rise to the House of Rothschild.</p>
<p>The headquarters of the Supreme Council of the Scottish Rite Freemasonry in Washington, D.C. is capped by an unfinished pyramid.</p>
<p>The symbol can also be represented as a hand gesture by touching both thumbs and index with both palm facing outwards.</p>
<p>Hip Hop artist Jay-Z uses the sign to represent Roc Nation and his record company, Roc-A-Fella Records. He calls it the Roc sign.</p>
<p>Pro-wrestler Diamond Dallas Page previously used the sign to indicate his signature move, the Diamond Cutter.</p>
<p>German head of state Angela Merkel uses the semaphore in reverse to form an inverted pyramid. </p>
<p>Merkel calls her pose the Merkel-Raute.</p>
<p>Like other symbols on this list, the pyramid is prominently displayed by Presidents,</p>
<p>On government building,</p>
<p>In Music videos,</p>
<p>And in Hollywood movies.</p>
<h2>Number 1: the All-Seeing Eye. </h2>
<p>The All-Seeing eye is the most recognized symbol of the Illuminati.</p>
<p>In ancient Egypt the eye represented the god Horus &#8211; protection, good health, royal power.</p>
<p>But its fame is mostly due to its prominent placement of the US dollar bill, the most highly circulated note on the planet.</p>
<p>The symbol, an eye floating over an unfinished pyramid, was added to the bill in 1935 by 33rd degree Freemason, President Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p>
<p>To Freemasons, the All-Seeing Eye represents GOATU, the Great Architect of the Universe, a placeholder term for whatever deity individual Masons happen to worship.</p>
<p>The eye in the triangle has been used by French and German Freemasons since at least 1770.</p>
<p>The All-Seeing eye appeared in the original design of the Great Seal of the United States.</p>
<p>Several committees and years later, it appears in its present form, floating over an unfinished pyramid, on the back of the Great Seal.</p>
<p>The eye is a representation of God favoring the prosperity of the United States. </p>
<p>The unfinished pyramid, the future growth of the nation.</p>
<p>Some researchers are not convinced.</p>
<p>They believe that the symbol is the left eye of Lucifer.  </p>
<p>It oversees its minions who are represented by individual, identical bricks making up the unfinished pyramid.  </p>
<p>The 13 steps are a tribute to the 13 bloodlines of the Illuminati, NOT the original 13 states.</p>
<p>The symbol first became associated with the Illuminati in 1955 with the publication of Roosevelt’s Communist Manifesto by Emanuel Josephson, </p>
<p>In addition to identifying the Eye and Pyramid as the insignia of the Illuminati, the author further contended that Adam Weishaupt (V) had written the blueprint for the New Deal.</p>
<p>The Roman numerals for 1776, inscribed at the bottom of the pyramid have nothing to do with the signing of the Declaration of Independence and the birth of the United States,<br />
but rather secretly memorialize the founding year of the Bavarian Illuminati.</p>
<p>The hand gesture can be made by making the sign of the pyramid with one eye peeking through the empty space, forming an eye in the pyramid.</p>
<p>The Hidden Eye sign is made by simply covering one eye with one hand.</p>
<p>The symbol and sign are common in music videos.</p>
<p>Hollywood movies.<br />
Corporate logos&#8230;<br />
And again, children cartoons&#8230;</p>

In this role, it regularly acts against the public good.
<p>Corporations are greedy, amoral agents employed by the <a href="http://www.illuminatirex.com/illuminati/">Powers That Be</a> in their plans for a <a href="http://www.illuminatirex.com/history-new-world-order/">New World Order</a>.

<p>Conspiracies are commonplace in corporate circles. In fact, they are expected. Ensuing scandals when the plot is publicly exposed are matter of course. Capitalist’s Founding Father Adam Smith writes:</p>
<blockquote class="emphasis"><p>“People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.”</p>

<p class="emphasis"><strong>THE CONSPIRACY:</strong> Top light bulb manufacturers collude to limit the lifetime of incandescent light bulbs necessitating more frequent replacement thus increasing profits.</p>
<p>On Christmas Day, 1924, representatives of major light bulb manufacturers from all over the world, including Philips, General Electric (GE), and Osram, met in a Geneva backroom to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoebus_cartel">form a cartel</a> controlling the manufacture and sale of light bulbs.</p>
<p>The cartel’s first order of business was to decrease the life expectancy of light bulbs on the market  to 1000 hours, instead of the then common 2500 hours.  Members were fined for not adhering to the guidelines until they developed a filament thin enough to achieve the cartel’s desired goal.  This feat makes the light bulb one of the first victims of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence">planned obsolescence</a>, an industry practice were otherwise durable products are designed to fail after a predetermined amount of time or use. Desktop printers, nylons, and iPods are other examples of planned obsolescence. The practice leads to massive piles of waste and landfills.</p>
<p>The cartel eventually dissolved as manufacturers outside the group began producing and marketing longer lasting bulbs. Today, even former cartel member Philips makes a LED-bulb that lasts over twenty years.</p>

<hr class="shortcode hr white"  />
<p>Despite worldwide condemnation of Nazi atrocities, IBM, bastion of US corporate establishment known for its enforced dress code circumvented the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_with_the_Enemy_Act_1914">Trading with the Enemy Act</a> to facilitate Hitler’s Final Solution and profit from the Nazi war machine.</p>
<p>IBM owned the punch card technology necessary to tabulate large amounts of data. The German licensee for IBM’s punch card technology was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehomag">Dehomag</a>, a 90% IBM-owned subsidiary. By 1933,  the Nazis had rounded up some 60,000 political prisoners in Dachau, Bavaria. </p>
<p>However, the task of separating Jews from the Aryan population proved difficult. The regime soon called for a national census so that it could more easily identify Jews and other undesirables within the Prussian population. Dehomag eagerly offered its services for the task and were able to identify 2 million Jews out of a population of 65 million, a much higher figure than previous assessment of around half a million. IBM used the proceeds to built its first factory in Berlin, anticipating further business with the Nazis.</p>
<p>Amongst <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identification_in_Nazi_camps">other forms of identification</a>, the punch card system proved immensely useful in identifying and displacing large segments of Europe’s population and placing them to work in forced-labor camps or sending them to their deaths. Each concentration camp was assigned a number (Dachau 003, Auschwitz 001) by IBM engineers who were tasked with programming individual punch cards. IBM designated Jews a 8, Gypsies a 12, and homosexual were given a 3. </p>
<p>Even individual causes of death were carefully documented; The number 4 meant the inmate had died by execution, 5 by suicide, while those who met death in the gas chambers were assigned a 6.</p>
<p>After the Nazi invasion of Poland, IBM <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/mar/29/humanities.highereducation">created a new subsidiary</a> called “Watson Business Machines” to help organize the mass deportation of polish Jews.

<p><img src="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/corporate-conspiracy-Lockheed-Martin.jpg" alt="corporate-conspiracy-Lockheed-Martin" width="644" height="336" /></p>
<p class="emphasis"><strong>THE CONSPIRACY:</strong> Senate investigation into arm manufacturer Lockheed Martin reveal that bribes are commonly practiced within the arms industry.</p>
<hr class="shortcode hr white"  />
<p>In the mid-70s, the Church Committee discovered evidence that the recently bailed-out arms manufacturer, Lockheed Martin routinely and systematically participated in mass-scaled bribery in order to unload its unpopular F-104 Starfighters to US-friendly governments.</p>
<p>There were good reasons for the F-104 low sales record. Essentially a rocket with ridiculously small wings, the plane was prone to crashing or exploding.  In Germany, the planes were known as “widow makers” (Witwenmacher) with 30% of planes lost. Canadians pilots lost nearly half their Starfighters. Pilot legend Chuck Yeager also nearly lost his life in a record breaking attempt. Not exactly quotable statistics for Lockheed’s sales brochures. </p>
<p>In Japan, top level members of business, government, and organized crime were involved in bribery. Takers included Japan&#8217;s head of government, Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka.  In Germany, Minister of Defense Franz Josef Strauss and his party also took a healthy commission on the sale of 900 Starfighters. Strauss was later a central character in Canada’s all-too-similar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_affair">Airbus Scandal</a>.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, the scandal embroiled the Dutch Royal Family when Prince Bernhard was exposed for  taking in a flat $1 million dollar fee for his role in selling F-104s. His dealings with Lockheed reveal that the  prince was quite <a href="http://www.bilderberg.org/bernhard.htm#Lockheed">familiar with these types of arrangements</a>.  </p>
<figure id="attachment_15678" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15678" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img src="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/corporate-conspiracy-Lockheed-Martin-Prince-Bernhard.jpg" alt="Laws are for peasants" width="300" height="194" class="size-full wp-image-15678" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-15678" class="wp-caption-text">Laws are for peasants</figcaption></figure>However the Prince was not prosecuted for his crimes after Queen Juliana, his wife, threatened to abdicate. The Netherlands is the sort of place where this sort of crap defense actually works. The Royals were never prosecuted, but their reputation was forever tainted. Even the prince’s oil-soaked warmongering buddies at the <a href="http://www.illuminatirex.com/secret-societies/#Bilderberg-Group">Bilderberg Group</a>  abandoned him publicly and he was forced to step down from the group he had cofounded.</p>
<p>The Lockheed Business Model was hardly unique to Lockheed, as Northman CEO Tom Jones <a href="https://youtu.be/e4CiiLhkfbw">testified in a 1975 Senate Sub-committee</a>, bribery was commonplace in the industry. Northrop would host high-ranking Pentagon officials in topless bars, fancy restaurants, and take them <a href="https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=W8wwAAAAIBAJ&#038;sjid=CAYEAAAAIBAJ&#038;pg=7289%2C1886306">on luxurious goose huntring trips</a>. </p>
<p>In 1979, <a href="https://youtu.be/Dw_RKEU0Xxs">Lockheed admitted</a> to paying out at least $202 million in bribes. The company also plead guilty to 4 counts of frauds and 4 counts of of making false statements to government officials.On the books, these “commission” were written off as “marketing costs”. </p>
<p>Bribery is rampant in other industries as well with <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/03/glaxosmithkline-fined-bribing-doctors-pharmaceuticals">Big Pharma</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/MAC2xeT2yOg?t=1m30s">Big Tobacco</a> also notable practitioners.</p>
<p>Lockheed itself made a perfect recovery. Despite its criticisms, the <a href="https://youtu.be/fChqJY9VzTU">F-104 is today lauded</a> as one of the first supersonic planes that helped the US achieve air superiority.  The plane was finally retired in 2004, one of the longest operational run for any military plane. Lockheed also achieved success with its parallel top secret development of the <a href="http://www.illuminatirex.com/area-51/">U2 spy plane at Area 51</a>. </p>

<p class="emphasis"><strong>THE CONSPIRACY:</strong> Pharmaceutical giant Bayer knowingly sells blood HIV-tainted blood to foreign markets after being barred from selling it in the US.</p>
<hr class="shortcode hr white"  />
<p>From the 1970s  to mid-1980s, pharmaceutical giant Bayer, best-known for its flag product Tylenol, and its subsidiary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutter_Laboratories">Cutter Biological</a>, sold HIV-infected blood to hemophiliacs throughout the United States. Hemophiliacs are at risk of bleeding out to death if not regularly treated with clogging agents provided by Bayer and other manufacturers.  <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sheenachi/4722966896/">Over half of the 16000 American hemophiliacs</a> contracted HIV through contaminated blood products.  The company routinely filled its supply with blood from high-risk groups such as prisoners and intravenous drug users.</p>
<p>Aside from obtaining its blood from dubious sources, the company could hardly be accused of knowingly selling contaminated blood. After all, effective tests for detecting HIV positive blood had yet to be developed.  Except that, in early 1983 the company was fully aware that people were contracting HIV and Hepatitis C through its <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/22/business/2-paths-of-bayer-drug-in-80-s-riskier-one-steered-overseas.html?pagewanted=print">plasma products</a>. In response, Bayer developed a new safer heat-treated process.</p>
<p>What comes next is what makes Bayer’s actions especially deplorable….</p>
<p>The company didn’t just go ahead and destroy its contaminated inventory. Claiming contractual obligations, the company decided to carry on manufacturing and selling its old product because it was cheaper to produce than its new safer blood. </p>
<p>As the tainted product became increasingly unmarketable in the United States and Europe, the company began <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/22/business/2-paths-of-bayer-drug-in-80-s-riskier-one-steered-overseas.html?pagewanted=print">unloading its tainted stocks on other international markets</a> such as Asia and South America.  When Hong Kong distributors warned of a medical emergency, the company told them that old stocks had to be used up before they could receive the new non-infected blood.</p>
<p>Bayer and three other manufacturers eventually <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/02/nyregion/pataki-signs-bill-letting-hemophiliacs-sue-companies-over-blood-clotting.html">settled claims in the United States for $620 million</a>. The companies admitted no guilt and warned that each infected hemophiliacs accepting the one-time $100,000 settlement would be barred from filing any future lawsuits against the companies.</p>
<p>Meanwhile In France, criminal charges were filed against high-level government officials including former Health Minister Edmond Herve, who was eventually <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/293367.stm">convicted of manslaughter</a>.</p>
<p>Other pharmaceutical companies involved in the Infected blood scandal beside Bayer and Cutter Biological include, Alpha Therapeutic Corporation, Institut Mérieux (now part of Sanofi), and Baxter. </p>

<p class="emphasis"><strong>THE CONSPIRACY:</strong> Ford Motors put profits over people when it decided that settling legal damages from people burning to death in car explosions following rear end collisions would be cheaper than mass recalling its bestselling Pinto automobiles.</p>
<hr class="shortcode hr white"  />
<p>With the Ford Motor Company feeling the impact of the Volkswagen Beetle in the small-car market, the race was on within the company to come up with an in into this lucrative market.  Enter Lee Iaccoca who had risen to the rank of Vice-President thanks to his previous success with Mustang.</p>
<p>With the goal of creating a car weighing no more than 2000 pounds at a cost of no more than $2000, Iaccoca began rushing the Pinto into production.  Ford engineers soon discovered that there was a problem with the rear gas tank.  Protruding bolts on the differential housing caused the gas tank to rupture and leak during rear collisions in every single internal test conducted by Ford. </p>
<p>However, expensive tooling for the production of Pintos were already well on their way, so accountants for the company ran a <a h ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost%E2%80%93benefit_analysis">cost-benefit analysis</a> and concluded that it would be cheaper for the company to settle any upcoming lawsuits out of court rather than begin the expensive retooling process. Ford was not ran by engineering decisions, but by sales decision. At the same time, the company lobbied Washington extensively to relax auto safety regulations.</p>
<p>The Pintos proved to be immensely popular once again making Iaccoca a hero of the automotive industry. However, the Pintos dirty secret could not be held indefinitely after Pintos started going boom all over the United States.  In the end between 500 to 900 people died in Pinto-related accidents. The accidents were especially atrocious as they usually involved the car’s occupants being trapped inside and slowly burning to death.  The problem could be remedied for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimshaw_v._Ford_Motor_Co.">as little as $1.80 per car</a>.</p>
<p>In 1977, Mother Jones published Pinto Madness after getting its hands on a  <a href="http://www.southerninjurylawyer.com/media/2009/05/ford-memo.pdf">Ford internal memo</a> in which the company coldly laid out the numbers, allocating each human life lost $200,000 and $67,000 per injured victims.  The memo concluded that the cost of settling legal cases would be around $49.5 million and estimated the cost of fixing the problem permanently at $137 million.</p>

<p>In the early 1900s, Goldman would peddled financial instruments known as Investment Trusts. Essentially, Goldman would form a trust and use its capital to buy Goldman stocks, sending its price soaring.  It would then form an additional trust and use its capital to buy shares in the first trust, sending its share price soaring as well as Goldman’s.  They repeated this process over and over. The widespread practice eventually caused the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929">1929</a> market crash and the resulting in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression">Great Depression</a>.</p>
<p>Goldman’s consistent price manipulation and overvaluing of tech companies prior to their Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) eventually gave us the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble">Dot.com Bubble</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Spoiler:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Think Sh!t<br />
Click on image to Play (Paramount Pictures)</figcaption></figure>At the turn of the millennium, Goldman began taken a position in the housing market. Mortgage loans and bonds had become popular investment vehicles and Goldman as well as other banks began aggressively promoting them. However, as the <a href="https://youtu.be/qIKNYxpsWvI">Lady in the Bathtub</a> explains, they soon ran out of healthy, genuine mortgage loans.  Banks began buying up Mortgages known as subprime loans and mixing them in with other loans. </p>
<p>Celebrity Chef <a href="https://youtu.be/27HIPU7tUaY">Anthony Bourdain describes</a> how these new packages were then marketed as a totally new product called Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDO’s). The banks used their influence to get credit rating agencies Standard &#038; Poor&#8217;s and Moody’s to certify these CDOs as investment grade.</p>
<p>However, since Goldman knew that a majority of the underlying mortgage loans making up CDOs were worthless, it began betting against its own products. It got large insurance company AIG to give the company protection in the eventuality that CDOs defaulted.  Since CDOs were investment grade, AIG readily agreed, seeing it as a sure bet.  As <a href="https://youtu.be/sD3ZSqCKOCg">Selena Gomez and Richard Thaler</a> explain, these bets on bets on bets were known as credit default swaps.</p>
<p>In the end, Goldman Sachs managed to benefit from the 2008 Financial Crisis. It’s largest competitor Lehman Brothers was left hanging in the wind and liquidated.  Goldman itself <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/national/200904_CREDITCRISIS/recipients.html"> received a $10 billion bailout</a>.  AIG received a $85 billion (eventually <a href="http://money.cnn.com/news/storysupplement/economy/aig/">$182 billion</a>) in bailout money and immediately repaid Goldman $13 billion to cover its lost bets. (aforementioned credit default swaps) This allowed Goldman to cover its positions and escape from the crisis which it helped create virtually unscarred. </p>
<p>The company recently <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/01/14/investing/goldman-sachs-settles-mortgage-probe/">settled with the US government for $5.1 billion</a> for its role in the financial crisis. In comparison, Goldman <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/oct/15/goldman-sachs-record-bonus-pot">paid out $16.7 billion</a> in bonus to its employees in 2009. To date, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/untouchables/">not a single Wall Street executive has gone to jail</a> for their role in the crisis. Not-so-coincidentally, Goldman Sachs was the <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/contrib.php?cid=N00009638">largest corporate donor</a> to Obama’s 2008 reelection campaign. </p>
<p>Rating agencies, who were suppose to safeguard subscribers against unsound financial instruments, tried to argue that their ratings were ultimately an opinion protected under the First amendment, but this didn&#8217;t <a href="http://reut.rs/1u1jbvA">really work out for them</a>.</p>

<p class="emphasis"><strong>THE CONSPIRACY:</strong> After its own scientists confirm the reality of global warming in the late 70s, oil giant Exxon begins funding climate change denial while simultaneously positioning itself for future Arctic drilling.</p>
<hr class="shortcode hr white"  />
<p>Oil giant Exxon Mobil is the <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/06/11/fortune-500-most-profitable-companies/">second most profitable</a> public corporation in the world and the largest of the Seven Supermajors (ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, Chevron, Total, ConocoPhillips, Eni), aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Oil">Big Oil</a>. In 1998, Exxon (Standard Oil of New Jersey) and Mobil/Esso (Standard Oil of New York) <a href="http://money.cnn.com/1998/12/01/deals/exxon/">merged to form ExxonMobil</a>, reuniting fragments of John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil and forming the world’s largest corporation.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1977, Exxon’s own senior scientists informed top leaders that the burning of fossil fuels, the company’s stock-in-trade, would eventually cause the planet to warm up causing mass worldwide catastrophes. The company spent the next few years <a href="http://insideclimatenews.org/news/15092015/Exxons-own-research-confirmed-fossil-fuels-role-in-global-warming">confirming the information</a>, and arrived at the same conclusion.</p>
<p>What did Exxon choose to do with this information?</p>
<p>The same thing any amoral multinational corporation does when it finds out that its flag product will eventually destroy the planet&#8230; it lied.</p>
<p>Exxon chose to deny climate change publicly, keeping the public in the dark and hooked on oil,  while simultaneously preparing and positioning themselves for an anticipated rise in global temperatures.</p>
<p>Of course, the company knew that no one would believe the world’s largest oil company when it claimed that its products did not contribute to global warming, so it took a page from Big Tobacco’s playbook and had someone else say it.</p>
<p>Exxon began pouring <a href="http://insideclimatenews.org/sites/default/files/styles/icn_full_wrap_wide/public/UCS%20Report.png">millions of dollars</a> into think tanks and <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Expert_for_hire">experts for hire</a>.  In turn, these oil-soaked “experts” wrote papers and <a href="https://youtu.be/gWT-EWKIR3M">appeared on television</a> denying the reality of global warming and <a href="http://insideclimatenews.org/news/22102015/Exxon-Sowed-Doubt-about-Climate-Science-for-Decades-by-Stressing-Uncertainty">sowing the seeds of doubt</a>. At least <a href="http://insideclimatenews.org/sites/default/files/documents/Royal%20Society%20Letter%20to%20Exxon%20%282006%29.pdf">39 Exxon-funded organisations</a> publicly misrepresented climate change science in its publications.  Big Oil pundits brought us the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kevin-grandia/the-30000-global-warming_b_243092.html">Oregon Petition</a> urging the rejection of the Kyoto Protocol. The petition received signatures from over 31,000 “scientists”, including “Doctor” Geraldine Halliwell of the British pop group <a href="https://youtu.be/gJLIiF15wjQ">Spice Girls</a>, as well as characters from M*A*S*H and Star Wars. Charles Darwin himself rose from the dead to express his distaste for clean air.</p>
<p><strong>The plan worked.</strong> Big Oil managed to convinced much of the population that global warming was a hoax. </p>

<p>By 2015, the US chair of Environment and Public Works was <a href="https://youtu.be/3E0a_60PMR8">throwing snowballs on the Senate floor</a>. Politicians who had once warned Americans about global warming <a href="https://youtu.be/6tW590-BH5c">completely flipped their positions</a>. Those who didn&#8217;t follow the party line, <a href="https://youtu.be/taKB2hewkog">were ostracized</a>. In the name of “freedom”, Exxon and the Fracking Kings <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_activities_of_the_Koch_brothers">Koch brothers</a> continuously lobby for less government regulations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Exxon explored the Arctic for possible drilling sites and positioned itself in anticipation of decreasing operating costs as polar ice sheets continued to melt.  The company made deals and signed long-term leases in Canada, the North Sea, and Russia. Exxon also raised its oil platforms to compensate for future rise in sea levels. Its engineers designed and laid out pipelines to withstand predicted coastal erosion resulting from rising temperatures.</p>
<p>At the same time, other corporate predators such as Goldman Sachs (see #2 above) who couldn’t give a f*ck whether global climate change is real or not are waiting in the sidelines and <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2009/06/could-cap-and-trade-cause-another-market-meltdown">promoting cap-and-trade, or similar schemes</a> in order to create yet another bubble and profit from climate change regulations.</p>

<h3>Corporations: Then and Now</h3>
<p>Corporate power continues to grow. Corporations <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_by_revenue">have larger economies</a> than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)">entire nations</a>, leading some to label modern society a <strong>corpocracy</strong>.</p>
<p>At its inception, the <a href="https://youtu.be/Y888wVY5hzw">corporation</a> was a useful short term tool used to facilitate the joint-financing of large-scale projects such as roads and bridges.  They were not allowed to participate in politics and lobbying was forbidden. They were easily tamed and federal and state governments revoked charters of misbehaving corporations. The corporation would be dissolved once its project was completed.</p>
<p>This all change following the Civil War in which the Robber Barons amassed large fortunes and were able to consolidate their power. By the end of the century, corporations had gained <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara_County_v._Southern_Pacific_Railroad">corporate personhood</a> giving them the same rights afforded to US citizens under the Constitution. They soon developed <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/our-humanity-naturally/201103/why-corporations-are-psychotic">pathological, narcissistic personalities</a>. The Barons went on to <a href="http://www.illuminatirex.com/illuminati-education/">redesign the school system</a>, the <a href="http://www.illuminatirex.com/new-world-order-banking/">banking system</a>, progressively gaining more influence and control over government institutions.</p>
<p>Joseph Campbell described how you could determine who controls the flow of information in a society, by <a href="http://www.illuminatirex.com/joseph-campbell-on-power-and-the-control-of-information/">identifying its tallest building</a>. Corporate skyscrapers have long dominated over government building and religious edifices. The vast majority of Americans receive their news from 6 media corporations. (CBS, Disney, Comcast, News Corp, Viacom, and Warner)</p>
<p>The centralization of power and the trend towards corporate monopolies and oligopolies continue at a frightening rate.  The government no longer breaks up monopolies, but instead, deregulates and passes legislations facilitating corporate mergers.  Corporations already deemed “too big to fail” by the US government are swallowing others becoming even larger.  Finance and banking is dominated by 6 banks. (Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley) These banks alone make up 60% of the entire US GDP and  take in 40% of all corporate profits. </p>
<p>Americans now get most of their food from 6 major corporations. (Nestle, Kraft, Unilever, General Mills, PepsiCo, and Coca-Cola)</p>
<p>There are forces constantly working towards <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/hi/littleprince/chapter13.html">affixing a price to everything</a>. Companies like Monsanto have taken advantage of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_v._Chakrabarty">life patents</a> to monopolize the seed industry,  putting  ecological diversity at risk in the process. Water privatization schemes have also become more prevalent throughout the world. </p>
<p>In the name of freedom, corporations work tirelessly through their armies of lawyers and lobbyists to deregulate all industries, <a href="http://www.illuminatirex.com/cannabis-conspiracy/">except the competing ones</a>, and to revoke laws that threaten to reduce their bottom lines. If there were no regulations keeping Big Tobacco from advertising its poison to kids, it would. At the same time, corporations have become addicted to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2015/03/17/the-united-states-of-subsidies-the-biggest-corporate-winners-in-each-state/">corporate welfare</a> while continuing to <a href="http://www.sanders.senate.gov/top-10-corporate-tax-avoiders">avoid paying taxes</a>.</p>
<p>When working side by side with corrupted governments, the corporation can do some pretty nasty damages. The infamous East India Company flooded China with opium and used free trade at its defense when Chinese officials tried to ban the sale of opiates within its borders. The British responded by attacking and taking possession of Hong Kong, to this day a major international drug trafficking and <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/outrageous-hsbc-settlement-proves-the-drug-war-is-a-joke-20121213">money laundering hub</a>. Today, “free” trade comes in the form of rigged international agreements such as NAFTA, and <a href="https://wikileaks.org/tpp-final/">TPP</a> which assure corporate rights supersede national sovereignty.  Corporations are a major force behind globalization.</p>
<p>Corporations have a history of getting in bed with the <a href="http://www.illuminatirex.com/cia-secret-wars/">CIA</a> to help overthrow elected governments who move against American foreign interests. The United Fruit Company (Chiquita) had such a central role to play in the overthrow of the Árbenz government in Guatemala (Operation PBSUCCESS) that the Agency gave it <a href="https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1952-54Guat/terms">its own cryptonym</a>. Industrial manufacturer ITT Corporation offered the CIA a cool million to overthrow Allende in Chile. (Project FUBELT)</p>
<p>Overthrowing the <strong>corpocracy</strong> won&#8217;t be easy. But, we have to try. Where can <strong><u>you</u></strong> start?</p>
<p>Here are <a href="http://www.corporations.org/solutions/">5 Not-so-easy Steps</a>.</p>

<h5 style="text-transform: none; margin: 0px 0px 5px 0px;">How can a bullet go through President Kennedy and Governor Connally and emerge in virtually mint condition on a hospital stretcher a few hours later?</h5>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/jfk-assassination-magic-bullet.jpg" alt="jfk-assassination-magic-bullet" width="644" height="336" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14839" /><br />

	<!-- shortcode box --> <div class="shortcode clearfix box   rounded shadow">The Magic Bullet, so-called for its seemingly magical properties as it traveled through two men and emerged virtually intact a few hours later. According to both official stories, the Warren Commission and the House Select Committee on Assassinations, a single bullet caused all non-fatal wounds to Kennedy and Connally despite evidence of multiple shots and bullet types. 
<p>The Magic Bullet remains one of the most compelling pieces of evidence against the government’s official story.</p></div> <!-- /shortcode box -->
<p>From the get-go, it Commission Exhibit no.399 had been a hard bullet to swallow. The <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=10402 ">FBI’s own report</a> had assumed three different bullets. The Warren Commission had also operated under this assumption until information became public in March 1964 that concrete debris caused by a bullet (or possibly, a bullet fragment) had struck <a href="https://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=18162">assassination witness James Tague</a>’s cheek. Chipped concrete showing distinctive bullet marks was later discovered confirming Tague’s story.</p>
<figure id="attachment_14853" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-14853" style="width: 256px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/CE399-magic-bullet.jpg" alt="Commission Exhibit #399 Aka The Magic Bullet" width="256" height="186" class="size-full wp-image-14853" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-14853" class="wp-caption-text">Commission Exhibit #399<br />Aka The Magic Bullet</figcaption></figure>This forced Warren Commission investigators to come up with an alternate explanation without damaging <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=756877">their predetermined conclusion</a> that all three shots came from the southeastern window of the 6th floor of the Texas School Book Depository.</p>
<p><strong>Enter the Magic Bullet.</strong></p>
<p>The bullet traveled 58 meters (189 feet), hit Kennedy in the back, changed direction and made its way upwards exiting his throat, paused a few seconds before entering Governor Connally&#8217;s back and exiting through his chest. It then passed through his wrist and lodged itself in the governor’s thigh before falling onto another patient’s gurney at Parkland Hospital a few hours later. </p>
<p>There are multiple problems with the single bullet theory. </p>
<p>The <a href="/jfk-dealey-plaza-videos/#zapruder">Zapruder film</a> shows Kennedy reaching for his throat when emerging from behind the road sign at <a href="http://www.assassinationresearch.com/zfilm/z225.jpg">frame 225</a>. However, Connally doesn’t react until at lesast two seconds later (no earlier than <a href="http://www.assassinationresearch.com/zfilm/z268.jpg">frame 268</a>) where he has no difficulty in holding his hat despite allegedly having a shattered wrist.  (The Zapruder film frame rate was 18.3 frames per second)</p>
<p>Connally himself repeatedly claimed that <a href="http://youtu.be/rSzGCKVGlOU">the same bullet that struck Kennedy had not struck him</a>. He distinctly remembered having time to turn around and look at Kennedy before feeling any pain.  </p>
<p>The bullet itself sits today in the National Archives in nearly intact condition despite shattering multiple bones while travelling through two men.</p>
<p>The Warren Commission purposely lowered the throat wound by about an inch. A lower throat wound would have caused damages to <a href="https://www.maryferrell.org/wiki/index.php/Photos_-_NARA_Evidence_-_JFK_Clothes">Kennedy’s shirt and tie</a>. </p>
<p>There weren&#8217;t any.</p>
<p>They also chose to raise Kennedy&#8217;s back wound by several inches in order to better line in up with his throat wound.  Dr. George Burkley, Kennedy’s personal physician, located the back wound “<a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=587&#038;relPageId=2">at about the level of the third thoracic vertebra.</a>” </p>
<p>Gerald Ford also fiddled with the wound&#8217;s location and claimed he wasn&#8217;t “altering history” when he changed the words in an initial Warren Commission draft from:</p>
<blockquote class="emphasis"><p>“A bullet had <strong>entered his back</strong> at a point slightly above the shoulder to the right of the spine.”</p></blockquote>
<p>to:</p>
<blockquote class="emphasis"><p>“A bullet had <strong>entered the back of his neck</strong> slightly to the right of the spine.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Michigan Congressman Ford remains known for his role in deceiving the public while serving on the Commission more than for any other political position <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/presidents/geraldford">he would later held</a>.<br />

<h5 style="text-transform: none; margin: 0px 0px 5px 0px;">Who impersonated Oswald in Mexico City in the months preceding the assassination?</h5>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/jfk-conspiracy-oswald-cia.jpg" alt="jfk-conspiracy-oswald-cia" width="644" height="336" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14844" /><br />
Lee Harvey Oswald was impersonated multiple times in the months preceding the assassination. Most importantly, one of the fake Oswald allegedly met with Valeriy Kostikov, the KGB’s head of assassination and sabotage in Mexico City.  The CIA ran surveillance on anyone who entered the Soviet embassy.</p>
<p>The impersonation of Oswald in Mexico is likely the most pertinent piece of evidence for conspiracy and is probably what caused powerful players in US intelligence to set in motion a cover-up. </p>
<figure id="attachment_14855" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-14855" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/Allen-W-Dulles.jpg" alt="Allen Dulles, CIA" width="160" height="216" class="size-full wp-image-14855" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-14855" class="wp-caption-text">Allen Dulles, CIA</figcaption></figure>Although this alone does not show direct involvement by the CIA in the planning and execution of the plot to assassinate John F. Kennedy, it severely limits the number of people who could have pulled such a con.  Who was sufficiently informed to know that a fake Communist plot would cause the CIA to engage in a cover-up?  </p>
<p>President Lyndon <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=912&#038;relPageId=7">Johnson used the “Mexico Incident”</a> to convinced distinguished Supreme Court Judge Earl Warren to lend his good name and reputation to support the <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=756877">preconceived conclusions of Oswald as a lone gunman</a> and lie to the American people in order to avoid going to war with the Soviets.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the initial police radio description of Oswald came directly from the <a href="http://history-matters.com/archive/jfk/cia/201/104-10015-10048/html/ARRB_9-20-95_0066a.htm">CIA’s file on Lee “Henry” Oswald</a>. </p>
<p>None other than disgraced CIA spymaster Allen Dulles, previously fired by Kennedy for his role in the Bay of Pigs fiasco, was named to the Warren Commission and quickly became the main gatekeeper and the true power behind the commission with most of the other members paying very little attention to their duties and delegating most of the workload to subordinates.</p>
<p>Warren Commission J. Lee Rankin wrote in a <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=60439&#038;relPageId=5">late January ‘64 memo</a> that, amongst other Dallas officials,  District Attorney <a href="http://youtu.be/xhckLcuEINg">Henry Wade</a>: “&#8230;was also aware of an allegation that Oswald was an informant for the CIA and carried Number 110669.” The CIA confirmed that 110669 did follow Agency protocol for identifying assets, but that the number had not been assigned to Lee Harvey Oswald, but rather, to an <a href="https://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?mode=searchResult&#038;absPageId=417948">Australian CIA person of interest</a>. </p>
<p>The CIA was very interested in Jim Garrison’s investigation into the assassination and the trial of Clay Shaw and it was later revealed that the Agency had spies within Garrison&#8217;s inner circle feeding them information. </p>
<p>We now know that Clay Shaw did <a href="https://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=43496&#038;relPageId=2">informed for the CIA from 1948 to 1956</a> and that he was <a href="https://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=497118">cleared for Project QK/ENCHANT</a>, which remains classified to this day.</p>
<p>One month following the assassination the Washington Post published an op-ed by President Harry Truman admonishing the CIA.  It began “<a href="http://www.maebrussell.com/Prouty/Harry%20Truman's%20CIA%20article.html">I think it has become necessary to take another look at the purpose and operations of our Central Intelligence Agency—CIA.</a> “ The piece, entitled Limit CIA Role To Intelligence, prompted Allen Dulles to <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2013/12/22/trumans-true-warning-on-the-cia/">travel to Missouri</a> for a tête-à-tête with the former President.</p>

<h3>The Alibi</h3>
<p>Shortly before the shooting, (~12:25pm) at a time where he was supposedly already settled in the Sniper&#8217;s Nest and at which the motorcade was scheduled to pass by the Texas Schoolbook Depository, Oswald told his interrogator that he was <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=946&#038;relPageId=637">having lunch on the first floor of the Texas School Book Depository</a>. </p>
<figure id="attachment_14908" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-14908" style="width: 200px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/jfk-conspiracy-oswald-alibi-norman.jpg" alt="Harold Norman" width="200" height="239" class="size-full wp-image-14908" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-14908" class="wp-caption-text">Harold Norman</figcaption></figure>Oswald also claimed to have seen two of his colleagues, Harold Norman and James “Junior” Jarman pass through the room while he was having lunch. </p>
<p>This was corroborated by both <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=39&#038;relPageId=210">Jarman</a> and <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=39&#038;relPageId=197">Norman</a> who passed the first floor on their way <a href="http://www.jfkassassinationgallery.com/displayimage.php?album=22&#038;pos=9">to the fifth floor</a> to get a better view of the motorcade. </p>
<p><strong>Oswald could not possibly have known this unless he was where he says he was.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Oswald’s alibi checks out.</strong></p>
<p>Oswald’s <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=946&#038;relPageId=646">FBI interrogator reported</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="emphasis"><p>“OSWALD stated that on November 22, 1963, he had eaten lunch in the lunch room at the Texas School Book Depository, alone, but recalled possibly two Negro employees walking through the room during this period. He stated possibly one of these employees was called ‘Junior’ and the other was a short individual&#8230;”</p></blockquote>
<p>Fritz wrote in <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=29103&#038;relPageId=1">his interrogation notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="emphasis"><p>“say two negr came in. One Jr. + short negro.”</p></blockquote>
<p>However, the Warren Commission questioned Jarman about <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=946&#038;relPageId=206">whether or not he had lunch with Oswald</a>, which he denied, giving the Warren Commission an excuse to dismiss Oswald’s alibi. (a similar technique was used to dismiss Hugues Film showing an empty Sniper’s Nest moments before the assassination. See below)</p>
<p>Conveniently, Fritz notes which would have confirmed Oswald’s alibi in the absence of any recordings or other notes taken during last century&#8217;s most high-profiled murder case, remained undiscovered until 1997.</p>
<p>Carolyn Arnold <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=328802">saw Oswald on the first floor at 12:15</a>, giving further collaboration for Oswald’s alibi.  She was never called by the Warren Commission to testify.</p>
<h3>No Eyewitness</h3>
<p>No one saw Oswald fire a rifle from the 6th floor of the school book depository.</p>
<p>One witness, Howard Brennan, standing outside the Texas School Book Depository, <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=141238">described a man</a> on the 6th floor resembling Oswald’s description “He was a white man in his early 30’s, slender, nice looking, slender and would weigh about 165 to 175 pounds. He had on light colored clothing but definitely not a suit.”</p>
<p>The Warren Commission chose to make Brennan its star witness against Oswald despite Brennan being unable to identify Oswald in a police lineup. Part of Brennan’s description of Oswald, although it could reasonably apply to Oswald, strangely resembles the <a href="http://history-matters.com/archive/jfk/cia/201/104-10015-10048/html/ARRB_9-20-95_0066a.htm">CIA’s description</a> of Oswald’s Mexico impostor. <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=142891">Oswald clothing</a> that day definitely could not be mistaken for being “light colored.”  </p>
<figure id="attachment_14907" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-14907" style="width: 200px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/jfk-conspiracy-eyewitness-acquilla-clemons.jpg" alt="Acquilla Clemons" width="200" height="239" class="size-full wp-image-14907" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-14907" class="wp-caption-text">Acquilla Clemons</figcaption></figure>Oswald also <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=74046">described the shirt</a> he had been wearing as being dark. Brennan was adamant that the shooter and Oswald had been <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=16369">wearing completely different clothes</a> in his Warren Commission testimony.</p>
<p>Witnesses Arnold Rowland, Carolyn Walther, Ronald Fischer and Robert Edwards also described light clothes.</p>
<p>Arnold Rowland <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=138621">gave a statement</a> that he saw a gunman at the  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/6th-floor-tsbd-southwestern-elm-pov-lg.jpg" title="View from southwestern corner of 6th floor of Texas School Book Depository" rel="lightbox[7066]">southwestern end</a> of the Texas School Book Depository’s 6th floor. (See <a href="http://youtu.be/4y9_d9L6NOU">video</a>) The Sniper’s Nest was on the opposite end of the building.</p>
<p>This selective dismissal of witnesses who don’t collaborate the official story was also used in the investigation of the shooting of police officer Tippit in which the Warren Commission chose to accept the testimony of witness <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=16514">Helen Markham</a>, while dismissing Oswald’s landlady <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=35&#038;relPageId=450">Earline Roberts</a> testimony which would have caused problematic timing.</p>
<p>The Warren Commission also decided that <a href="http://youtu.be/zTjq7jz8b5g">Acquilla Clemons</a> did not exist.</p>
<h3>Impossible Timing</h3>
<p>The Warren Commission’s timeline allowed 90 seconds for Oswald to zigzag his way through stacks of boxes while he crossed the 6th floor, hid his rifle, ran down the stairs while avoiding being seen by Vicky Adams (see <a href="http://youtu.be/ldJ3MPRCwV8">Girl on the Stairs</a>) who was coming down from the fourth floor at the same time, buy a coke from the vending machine on the <a href="http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh22/html/WH_Vol22_0058a.htm">2nd floor</a> and calmly sip on it before Officer Baker (seen running into the School Book Depository in <a href="/jfk-dealey-plaza-videos/#couch" title="Couch Film">the Couch film</a>) in the company of Texas School Book Depository manager Roy Truly briefly question him before moving on to the upper floors.</p>
<p>(See Warren Commission <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/wiki/index.php/Photos_-_WCD_Photos_-_Texas_School_Book_Depository_-_p1">photos of the Texas School Book Depository</a>)</p>
<h3>Empty Sniper&#8217;s Nest</h3>
<p>The <a href="/jfk-dealey-plaza-videos/#hughes" title="Robert Hughes Film">Robert Hughes film</a> shows a clearly empty sniper&#8217;s nest just seconds before the assassination.  The <a href="/jfk-dealey-plaza-videos/#bronson" title="Bronson Film">Charles Bronson film</a> taken around the same time also reveals an empty Sniper&#8217;s Nest.<br />
<figure id="attachment_14857" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-14857" style="width: 644px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/hughes-film-tsbd-empty-nest.jpg" alt="Frame from Hughes Film showing an empty sniper’s nest" width="644" height="436" class="size-full wp-image-14857" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-14857" class="wp-caption-text">Frame from <a href="/jfk-dealey-plaza-videos/#hughes" title="Robert Hughes Film">Hughes Film</a> showing an empty <a href="http://history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh17/html/WH_Vol17_0112a.htm">sniper&#8217;s nest</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Warren Commission got around this by implying that the Hughes film was <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=74068">shot 10 minutes before the assassination</a>, despite Kennedy&#8217;s car seen passing the Texas School Book Depository in the same sequence.</p>

<h5 style="text-transform: none; margin: 0px 0px 5px 0px;">Why did Oswald pass on an easy shot as the motorcade traveled down Houston Street in favor of a more challenging target on Elm Street?</h5>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/jfk-conspiracy-crossfire.jpg" alt="jfk-conspiracy-crossfire" width="644" height="336" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14842" /><br />
The motorcade had to execute a difficult 90 degree turn coming from Main street onto Elm Street. The slow turn would have been an ideal spot for a shooter located at the southeastern corner of the 6th floor of the Texas School Book Depository and the view is unobstructed by any trees. Meanwhile shooter located in the Sniper&#8217;s Nest would have his line of sight blocked by a giant oak tree until at least Zapruder frame #210. </p>
<p>X-110, the Presidential limo used on November 22, was <a href="http://www.thehenryford.org/research/kennedyLimo.aspx">not equipped with any bullet-proof components</a> whatsoever. Fortunately, it had blue mouton rugs, 2 telephone radios and interior floodlights. Both the <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=138614">windshield</a> and its <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=138613">frame</a> were damaged in the shooting.</p>
<p>Oswald allegedly chose to take shots as the motorcade was going down Elm Street.  Conveniently, this put Kennedy in a crossfire between the Texas School Book Depository and another team located near the Grassy Knoll.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="http://youtu.be/jyaLZHiJJnE">ghostbusting</a>, a crossfire, or triangulation, is a good thing in the assassinating business.</p>
<p>Jim Dieugenio and Jim Garrison both speculated that there were three sniper teams operating a L-shaped ambush or triangulation.  One team was located in (or on) the Texas School Book Depository <strong>(A)</strong>, one (or two) in the Grassy Knoll  <strong>(C)</strong> area (possibly including Jack Ruby) and another on the second floor or on the roof of the Dal Tex Building <strong>(B)</strong>. </p>
<p>Where was Lee Harvey Oswald?  Evidence suggest that he was on the <a href="#oswaldalibi" title="No. 3 Oswald’s Alibi">first floor of the Texas School Book Depository</a>.</p>
<p>The assassination simulator, <a href="http://www.fileplanet.com/192027/190000/fileinfo/JFK-Reloaded-v1.1-%28Free-Game%29">JFK: Reloaded</a> (Free download @IGN’s Fileplanet) is especially useful in viewing the motorcade from different locations.

The 1979 House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded that “The Secret Service was <a href="http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0129a.htm">deficient in the performance of its duties</a>” in its final report on the Kennedy Assassination.</p>
<h3>Security Stands Down</h3>
<p>An ABC affiliate in Dallas filmed <a href="http://youtu.be/x7WrBVm9ALM">Kennedy’s arrival and departure from Love Field Airport</a>.  As the Motorcade is leaving Love Field and two secret agents are jogging alongside the back of the limousine, Secret Service in Charge Emory Roberts, riding in the follow-up car, calls back the agents.</p>
<p>Secret Service Agent Henry Rybka is <a href="http://youtu.be/x7WrBVm9ALM?t=4m59s">clearly confused</a> at the order and can be seen shrugging three times as he takes position in one the follow-up cars.</p>
<p>Two secret agents usually ride on the back bumper of the Presidential limo and serve as human shields for the President’s protection.  Strangely, Kennedy himself has been blamed for being uncooperative with the Secret Service in their effort to protect him. The assertion is <a href="http://www.jfklancer.com/LNE/limo.html">not supported by facts</a>.</p>
<h3>Presidential Limo Slows Down</h3>
<p>The <a href="/jfk-dealey-plaza-videos/#orville" title="Nix Film">Orville Nix film</a> of the assassination shows Kennedy’s limo slowing down moments before the fatal headshot, contrary to all Secret Service training and protocol.  The rear tail light can be seen glowing red in the <a href="/jfk-dealey-plaza-videos/#muchmore" title="Muchmore Film">Mary Muchmore film</a> suggesting that driver William Greer was applying the brakes at that moment.<br />

<p>The slower speed also explains how Secret Service agent Clint Hill was able to reach the Presidential limo despite the wide (and fortunate for assassins) gap between it and the Secret Service follow-up car.</p>
<h3>Destruction of Crime Scene Evidence</h3>
<p>Although photographs were taken of the limo’s damaged windshield, witnesses reported Secret Service using a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/83057948@N07/8012773651/in/photostream/">mop and bucket</a> to wash off blood splatters from the Presidential Limousine.  Additionally, the limo was <a href="https://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=226698">quickly stripped and rebuilt</a>.</p>
<p>The Secret Service might have been especially deficient on November 22nd partly because agents <a href="http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh18/pdf/WH18_CE_1019.pdf">were partying until early morning</a> at “The Cellar”, an all-night beatnik club.</p>

<h5 style="text-transform: none; margin: 0px 0px 5px 0px;">Why are autopsy records missing, destroyed, or altered?</h5>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/jfk-conspiracy-autopsy.jpg" alt="jfk-conspiracy-autopsy" width="644" height="336" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14840" /><br />
Immediately following Kennedy’s death at Parkland Hospital in Dallas, Kennedy’s body was flown to Washington and brought to Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland. It was determined that the autopsy should be conducted in a Navy hospital, and thus the operation would be under control of the military and more importantly subject to the the military&#8217;s chain of command.</p>
<p>The autopsy was not handled by a forensic pathologist as is commonly the case for gunshot-wound victims. The autopsy for the most high-profile murder investigation of the 20th century was left to two general pathologists, Navy officers Drs. James Humes and Thornton Boswell, trained to determine conventional causes of death such as cancers or heart attacks. Furthermore, Humes and Boswell were little more than hospital administrators who hadn&#8217;t seen blood in years.   </p>

Finck was intimidated by the many admirals and generals in the autopsy room barking orders at he and other physicians. He testified at the Garrison trial that one of the generals ordered him not to dissect JFK’s back wound to determine the origin of the shot. </p>
<p>An extra 40 minutes of <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/wiki/index.php/Audio_-_Other">audio recordings from Air Force One</a> carrying Kennedy’s body from  Dallas to Washington <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=146531&#038;relPageId=20">hints that General Curtis Lemay</a> might have been the cigar-smoking general giving orders during the autopsy.</p>
<h3>Entrance Wound in Throat</h3>
<p>The autopsy team had been ignorant that doctors in Dallas had expanded the throat wound and inserted a tube in it (a <a href="http://youtu.be/bHasd-Uj4Mo">tracheotomy</a>) in order to get Kennedy breathing again. </p>
<p>Doctor Malcolm Perry who examined the wound before performing the procedure determined it to be an entrance wound. He made originally made the statement at the <a href="http://22november1963.org.uk/jfk-parkland-hospital-press-conference">Parkland Hospital press conference</a> well before the political aspects of the case had begun altering the facts.</p>
<h3>Large Exit Wound at the Back of the Head</h3>
<p>All doctors present in <a href="http://www.jfklancer.com/Trauma1.html">Trauma Room 1</a> and attending staff in Dallas remember the back of Kennedy&#8217;s head being blown out indicating a shot coming from the front of the President.<br />

<h3>Autopsy Photographs and X Rays</h3>
<p>Instead of using actual photographs of the autopsy, which might have conflicted with their story, the Warren Commission had artist H.A. Rydberg redraw the photos based on directions from Dr. James Humes. </p>

<p>Officially, the autopsy photos and x-rays remain classified and were strictly exempted from being released by the Assassination Records Review Board. However, photographs <a href="http://www.jfklancer.com/photos/Autopsy_photos/index.html">made their way into public hands</a> and black and white bootleg copies were printed in David Lifton’s Best Evidence in 1988. These were previously obtained by Mike Crouch thought retired Secret Service agent James Fox and made available to the assassination research community. </p>
<p>Around the same time <a href="http://youtu.be/eIDb8MMraqg">CIA agent Regis Blahut</a> was busy pilfering through the safe holding classified assassination documents, including the autopsy photographs, JFK researcher Robert Groden, who had been consulting for the House Select Committee on Assassination clandestinely snapped pictures of the photographs. These colored photographs were printed in the Globe supermarket tabloid in 1991.</p>
<h3>Missing Evidence</h3>
<p>Dr. James Humes also took it upon himself to unconventionally <a href="http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/arrb/master_med_set/md9/html/Image1.htm">burn his notes and all preliminary reports</a> relating to the Presidential autopsy. Kennedy&#8217;s brain, key autopsy photographs, as well as skull fragment which supposedly prove the direction of the bullet which caused the fatal head wound are also conveniently missing.</p>
<p>Although the Warren Commission investigated unquestionably useless leads such as <a href="https://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=171600">Marina Oswald’s supposedly bad teeth</a>, it failed to interview Kennedy’s personal physician, George Burkley who accompanied Kennedy from the revival attempts at Bethesda Hospital in Dallas, through the flight to DC, during the autopsy and finally Kennedy’s embalming. </p>
<p>Burkley later became convinced of conspiracy in the assassination of John F. Kennedy and made <a href="https://www.maryferrell.org/wiki/index.php/The_Missing_Physician">efforts to contact</a> the House Select Committee on Assassination to expand on information that &#8220;<a href="http://www.jfklancer.com/Dr_Burkley.html">others besides Oswald must have participated.</a>&#8221;</p>

<h5 style="text-transform: none; margin: 0px 0px 5px 0px;">Why did Kennedy react to a shot from the front?</h5>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/jfk-conspiracy-back-and-to-the-left.jpg" alt="jfk-conspiracy-back-and-to-the-left" width="644" height="336" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14841" /><br />
The Zapruder film is compelling visual evidence of a shot coming from the front of the presidential limo.  Kennedy’s head clearly moves to the back and to the left following the fatal headshot at Zapruder frame 313.</p>
<figure id="attachment_14871" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-14871" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/jfk-conspiracy-Malcolm-Kilduff.jpg" alt="Assistant Press Secretary Malcolm Kilduff indicating the fatal headshot in an early briefing to reporters" width="250" height="181" class="size-full wp-image-14871" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-14871" class="wp-caption-text">Assistant Press Secretary Malcolm Kilduff <a href="http://youtu.be/V73-unR1Rq4">indicating the fatal headshot</a> in an early briefing to reporters</figcaption></figure>]The film also shows chunks of brain matter projected towards the back of the car. Mrs. Kennedy is then observed desperately trying to pick her husband’s brain from the car’s trunk. Motorcycle officers Bobby Hargis and B. J. Martin who were closely following the limo were stuck so violently with fragments that they believed they themselves had been shot.</p>
<p>The general public was unable to view the Zapruder film.</p>
<p>Time-Life publisher C.D.Jackson quickly arranged to purchase the rights to the Zapruder film.  Jackson was CIA and active in its <a href="http://www.illuminatirex.com/operation-mockingbird/">Operation Mockingbird</a>, a CIA program of media infiltration,  Under Jackson’s direction, Time-Life failed to exploit the Zapruder film’s commercial potential and instead chose to lock up copies of the film in its private vault.</p>
<p>The public had to trust government officials and the media to tell them about the film’s content. However, its trust was misplaced..</p>
<p>After having the opportunity to view the film, highly-respected CBS anchorman Dan Rather lied, claiming that Kennedy’s “head could be seen to <a href="http://youtu.be/kiSoxFHyjGY?t=2m12s">move violently forward.</a>”</p>
<p>Finally in 1975, a bootleg copy of the Zapruder film was <a href="http://youtu.be/nxCH1yhGG3Q">shown on national television</a>, The footage, and especially the frames following frame 313, caused a public outrage which eventually led to a second official investigation into the JFK assassination, the House Select Committee on the Assassination.<br />

<p>The Committee discovered that the Warren Commission had suppressed its study by Larry Sturdivan at the Aberdeen Proving Ground who shot ten skulls with a Mannlicher-Carcano and was unable to replicate the so-called “<a href="http://www.jfklancer.com/galanor/jet_effect_text.html ">jet effect</a>”. He found that if you hit something (eg. a watermelon or a Kennedy&#8217;s head) from the back, it will inevitably be propelled forward.</p>
<p>Kennedy’s reaction to the headshot in the Zapruder footage as well as acoustic evidence from a recording of a police CB radio convinced the committee “that  President John F. Kennedy was probably assassinated <a href="http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0063a.htm">as the result of a conspiracy</a>.”</p>
<p>However, they also determined that the shooter located on the grassy Knoll missed…. </p>
<p>&#8230;and that everything else happened exactly how the Warren Commission says it did. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f62f.png" alt="😯" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3>Multiple Witnesses</h3>
<p>There were <a href="http://22november1963.org.uk/jfk-assassination-grassy-knoll-witnesses">over 40 witnesses</a> to shots coming from the Grassy Knoll, including Abraham Zapruder who believed that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404052200/http://www.history-matters.com/analysis/Witness/witnessMap/documents/Zapruder_CD87grey_0001a.jpg">shots had came from behind him</a>. Many spectators are seen running up the Grassy Knoll in the <a href="/jfk-dealey-plaza-videos/#hughes" title="Robert Hughes Film">Robert Hughes film</a>.</p>
<p>Famously, railroad worker Sam Holland, who was standing with a group on the railway bridge,  described a “<a href="http://youtu.be/o8LnoCA0qR0?t=2m10s">puff of smoke</a>” coming from the trees behind the fence on top of the Grassy Knoll. <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=14054">His testimony</a> was ignored by the Warren Commission.</p>
<h3>Badge Man</h3>
<p>Dallas police officer Joe Smith also heard shots coming from the Grassy Knoll. He ran up the hill and was able to smell gunpowder. He pull out his gun after encountering a suspicious  individual but holstered his weapon after the gentleman <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=18145">identified himself as a member of the secret service</a>.</p>
<p>Some researchers believe that Badge Man is visible in the <a href="/jfk-dealey-plaza-videos/#orville" title="Orville Nix Film">Orville Nix film</a> and in the <a href="/wp-content/uploads/jfk-conspiracy-moorman.jpg"" alt="Moorman Photograph" rel="lightbox[7066]">Moorman Photograph</a>, however, Badge Man can’t be seen in the <a href="/jfk-dealey-plaza-videos/#bell" title="Bell Film">Bell film</a> of that area.</p>
<p>All secret service agents were part of the motorcade and none were posted anywhere on the ground or at Dealey Plaza. </p>
<p>The Warren Commission ignored or dismissed all witnesses that place shots coming from a different location than the 6th floor of the Texas School Book Depository.</p>

<h3>Was Lee Harvey Oswald a FBI informant?</h3>
<p>The matter of Oswald being an informant for the FBI was one of the primary concerns of the Warren Commission. It had determined to crush rumors of any ties between Oswald and the FBI and/or the CIA, whether they be true or not.</p>
<p>However, the rumors were not so easily dismissed.  General Counsel for the Warren Commission, J. Lee Rankin wrote in a <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=60439&#038;relPageId=3">January ‘64 memo</a> that he knew from a good source that Oswald was a FBI informant regularly receiving $200 month though a FBI account numbered 179. </p>
<p>The Warren Commission held an emergency meeting on January 22nd to discuss the matter. Most of this meeting was held off-the-record and Rankin’s memo linked above is the only record we have of those portions.</p>
<p>Rankin admitted that they were powerless against the FBI and that even if Oswald had been an informant,he was “confident that the <a href="https://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=172701">FBI would never admit it</a>” and “their records will never show it&#8230;&#8221; He noted that Oswald’s use of aliases and postal boxes would be in keeping with the methods of an undercover agent.</p>
<p>At the same meeting, Allen Dulles suggested that the records of the sessions itself  <a href="https://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=172708">should be destroyed</a>. (A seemingly recurring theme with Mr. Dulles)</p>
<p>At the following meeting of January 27th Rankin said that the Department of Justice was afraid to confront Hoover with the allegation and that he should <a href="https://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=172721">go ask Hoover himself</a>. but Earl <a href="https://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=172726">Warren cautioned him against</a> this strategy.  Dulles pointed out that whoever might have been Oswald’s contact at the FBI would <a href="https://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=172737">never talk</a> about it anyway. </p>
<p>The Warren Commission failed to pursue the matter any further.</p>
<p>The Commission might have been onto something.  </p>
<p>In the week preceding the assassination, Oswald had dropped off a sealed letter for Agent James Hosty at the Dallas FBI Field Office.  Immediately following Oswald’s murder by Jack Ruby on the 24th, Special-Agent-in-Charge Gordon Shanklin ordered Hosty to <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/wiki/index.php/Destruction_of_the_Oswald_Note">destroy the note and a memorandum</a> relating to Oswald.  Interestingly, it was later revealed that Ruby himself had been a <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=956&#038;relPageId=210">FBI informant</a>.</p>
<p>The note’s destruction wasn’t revealed to the public until Hosty’s <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=1406">testimony to the Church Committee</a> in 1975. Shanklin claimed <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=1423">not to recall the incident</a>.</p>

<p>In August of ‘63, Oswald hired a few pamphleteers and <a href="https://youtu.be/D1F_G5ku7KM">distributed pro-Castro leaflets</a> stamped with the address 544 Camp Street, the office of  <a href="http://spartacus-educational.com/JFKbringuier.htm">Carlos Bringuier</a>, an anti-Castro exile. Oswald deliberate trolling of Bringuier worked. Bringuier and his buddies came out swinging and both men were arrested.  The pair then <a href="http://youtu.be/Ao2a9mRWkso">appeared in a radio debate</a>, establishing Oswald bona fides as a pro-Castro activist.</p>
<p>New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison discovered that <strong>544 Stamp Street</strong> and the office of Guy Banister, former FBI turned private detective, at <strong>531 Lafayette Street</strong> were in actuality the <a href="https://www.google.com.tw/maps/@29.948153,-90.069708,3a,89.9y,129.2h,70.34t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s7Id1klq1U5btRZ9NI_ChBQ!2e0">same building</a>.  However, his claim that both entrances led to the same office is <a href="http://www.jfk-online.com/jfk100camp.html">more than likely mistaken</a>. Garrison was interested in Banister’s work with David Ferrie, Lee Harvey Oswald and anti-Castro Cuban exiles in New Orleans.</p>
<p>Oswald’s previous attempts to reach out to the Communist Party USA and the Socialist Workers Party leads researcher <a href="http://youtu.be/mOjDVyg1BVA?list=PLekdlDxhmF9zmPtbfRr11mh1BrFcEzmlQ">David Kaiser</a> to raise the possibility that Oswald was part of a <a href="http://www.illuminatirex.com/fbi-cointelpro/">FBI COINTELPRO</a> operation to discredit the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.  Oswald had written to the Fair Play for Cuba Committee in New York, but was told that New Orleans was a dangerous place and not a suitable location for a chapter. Nevertheless Oswald proceeded to rent an office and to take the role of secretary for his chapter of one. He even did a <a href="https://youtu.be/Tx06JfhXYUs">TV interview</a> the month before the assassination further establishing his Marxist credentials.</p>
<p>The FBI had used similar methods in the past when it had created a fake W.E.B. Du Bois Club, a Communist youth organization, in order discredit it.</p>
<p>In 1978, <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=95331">FBI Agent William Walter testified</a> that Oswald had been an informant to the New Orleans office.</p>

<h3>Gunshot Residue Tests</h3>
<p>Oswald was tested for gunshot residue on his hands and on his right cheek. The results proved that <strong>Oswald had not fired a rifle on November 22nd.</strong></p>
<p>A few hours after entering Dallas police custody, liquid Paraffin wax was applied to both of <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=946#relPageId=204&#038;tab=page">Oswald’s hand and to his right cheek</a>.  Once the cast hardened, it was examined for barium (Ba), antimony (Sb), and lead (Pb), chemical elements left behind following a riffle or gunshot.</p>
<p>The paraffin casts were examined using two different methods:</p>
<p>A spectrographic analysis of the cast revealed traces of nitrates on both of Oswald’s hands, <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=62258&#038;relPageId=23">but not on his cheek</a>. The negative result for the cheek proved that Oswald had not fired a riffle, meaning he could not have fired at Kennedy. </p>
<p>Additionally, the chemical residue found on his hands were not definite proof that he had fired a revolver as these chemicals are found in everyday items such as cigarettes, paint, soap, and more importantly, <strong>printing ink</strong>, abundant on books and boxes that Oswald had been carrying around all morning as part of his work duties.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Dallas Police announced to the press that Oswald <a href="https://youtu.be/HCcfmZdxpJA?t=2m37s">had fired a weapon that day</a>, carefully omitting mentioning that he had conclusively not fired rifle. The news soon went national further convicting Oswald in the public’s mind.</p>
<p>Due to the high-profile nature of the case, the Paraffin casts were also put through a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141109211352/http://archaeometry.missouri.edu/naa_overview.html">neutron activation analysis</a> by the FBI in conjunction with the Atomic Energy Commission. The test is able to detect even smaller amounts of chemical elements. Once again, it confirmed that Oswald could not be <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=58211&#038;relPageId=171">specifically associated</a> with the rifle.</p>
<p>The Warren Commission chose to dismiss all the cast samples as contaminated as well as the results of both the spectrographic analysis and the neutron activation analysis. </p>
<h3>State of the Rifle</h3>
<p><strong>Commission Exhibit 139</strong>, the <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=138180">Mannlicher-Carcano rifle</a> found on the 6h floor of the Texas School Book Depository was not in operable condition.</p>
<p>The US Army had to <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=39&#038;relPageId=451">add metal shims</a> to the telescope in order to use it, and even then, it would not stay true to target after being fired. The bold action mechanism and the trigger also <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=39&#038;relPageId=455">proved to be defective</a>. </p>
<figure id="attachment_14882" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-14882" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/jfk-conspiracy-rifle-test-tower-tsbd-comparison-CU-Doc14.jpg" alt="Tower-Texas School Book Depository comparison Document 24, Cover-Up" width="250" height="239" class="size-full wp-image-14882" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-14882" class="wp-caption-text">Test Tower-Texas School Book Depository comparison<br />Document 24, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0966277201/illuminatirex-20" class="broken_link">Cover-Up</a></figcaption></figure>At the behest of the Commission, the FBI and US Army conducted tests at the Army’s Ballistic Research Laboratory at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds.  Expert marksmen were unable to replicate <a href="https://youtu.be/a5IWK9sRYTs">Oswald’s feat</a>, despite shooting from a <a href="http://history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh17/html/WH_Vol17_0143b.htm">spacious perch half the height of the Texas School Book Depository</a>’s  6th floor and shooting at stationary targets. </p>
<p>Expert marksmen struggled to hit stationary targets within the Warren Commission&#8217;s timeframe of <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=946#relPageId=141&#038;tab=page">up to 7.9 seconds</a>. However, since the Commission concluded that Oswald would not have shot at the President <a href="https://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=946#relPageId=122&#038;tab=page">before Zapruder frame #210</a>, due to his line-of-sight being obscured by an oak tree; and with the final head shot at Zapruder frame #313, this leaves only 5.6 seconds for the full sequence of shots. (313-210=103, Zapruder&#8217;s camera shot 18.3 frames per second, so 103&divide;18.3=5.6)     </p>
<p>This alone is enough to debunk the Warren Commission&#8217;s version of events, unless we are to believe that the Tague shot came <em>after</em> the fatal blow. All witnesses in Dealey Plaza reported the head shot as the final shot.</p>
<p>None of the experts were able to replicate Oswald’s <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=39#relPageId=411&#038;tab=page">timing and precision</a>. Keep in mind, Oswald was <u><strong>not</strong></u> an expert marksman.</p>
<h3>Fingerprints</h3>
<p>While examining the 6th floor rifle recovered on the afternoon of the assassination, Dallas Police department Lieutenant J.C. Day noticed possible fingerprints on the trigger as well as on the finger guard of CE 139, so <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=73546">he dutifully</a> photographed it, placed cellophane over the prints and send the rifle to the FBI forensic lab in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>The FBI found the two prints to be unusable. They carefully examined the rifle for any other fingerprints and concluded that they were <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=13229">no usable prints</a>. None of the 3 spend cartridges <a href="http://history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh17/html/WH_Vol17_0124a.htm">found in the sniper’s nest</a> had prints either. They returned the rifle to Dallas on the 24th.</p>
<p>Five days later, Lieutenant Day suddenly remembered that he,  <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=1142#relPageId=868&#038;tab=page">totally alone</a> and isolated, <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=13469">had lifted a complete and perfect print</a> from the rifle’s barrel with scotch tape during his initial November 22nd examination. He had also omitted to take a photograph before taking the print <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=1142#relPageId=868&#038;tab=page">on orders of Police Chief Jesse Curry</a>.  He also neglected to send it to the FBI crime lab along with every other pieces of evidence related to the case. On the 29th, he sent the newly-rediscovered print to Washington <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=946#relPageId=147">with a note</a> “off underside gun barrel near end of foregrip C2766”.  Sure enough, the print (<a href="http://history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh17/html/WH_Vol17_0159a.htm">CE 639</a>) matched Oswald’s right palm perfectly.  .</p>
<p>In 1978, an <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=59637#relPageId=8">FBI memo revealed</a> that the Warren Commission had been skeptical of Lieutenant Day’s claims. It failed to mention it in its final report.</p>
<h3>A Convenient Paper Trail</h3>

<p>If this had been a really cheesy movie, the police would have found an advertisement with the rifle circled on it. Oh wait… <a href="/wp-content/uploads/jesse-curry-JFK-Assassination-Files-p99.jpg" title="jesse-curry-JFK-Assassination-Files-p99" rel="lightbox[7066]">they did</a>. </p>
<p>The only reason Oswald would order a rifle through mail order from Chicago in open carry &#8211; no id required Texas would be to leave a paper trail. Could Oswald have been building up is bono fides as part of his mission to infiltrate and sabotage the Fair Play for Cuba Committee movement? Note that the FBI’s COINTELPRO used agent provocateurs to infiltrate otherwise peaceful groups and incite them into doing violence.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=946#relPageId=40&#038;tab=page">FBI was easily able to trace</a> the sale back to a mail order house in Chicago made to A.J. Hidell, the <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=946#relPageId=431&#038;tab=page">false personality created by Oswald</a> for his non-existent New Orleans chapter of Fair Play for Cuba. He apparently chose the name Hidell, because it rhymed with Fidel. (no relation to the present author)</p>
<p>Marina Oswald’s testimonies were used to tie Oswald to the rifle. Unfortunately, her claims have been wildly inconsistent. Marina was swiftly isolated from the public following her husband’s death and kept under constant watch. She was routinely questioned by the FBI and the Secret Service, and constantly threatened with deportation back to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>She initially claimed that she had <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=1317#relPageId=793&#038;tab=page">never seen Oswald with the rifle</a> and that he never practiced. By the time she testified to the Commission she had reversed her statement and claimed she had <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=37#relPageId=26&#038;tab=page">seen Oswald cleaning and sighting the rifle</a>.</p>
<p>She also testified to hearing Oswald telling her that he was going out to practice with his rifle <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=1317#relPageId=227&#038;tab=page">in early March</a>. However, Oswald was <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=946#relPageId=143&#038;tab=page">not yet in possession</a> of the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>On November 29th, President Lyndon Johnson passed <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=26032" class="broken_link">Executive Order 11130</a>, forming what would become known to history as the Warren Commission to evaluate all the facts and circumstances surrounding the assassination of Kennedy, including the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>
<p>But they were a few caveats…</p>
<p>First, it had to be done by the election of 1964.</p>
<p>Fair enough, no President wants to drag dirty business into an election year.</p>
<p>Secondly, the commission had to <u><strong>conclude that Oswald was the lone assassin.</strong></u></p>
<p>Wait… What? Why did the most powerful office in the United States insist on a preconceived conclusion of Oswald’s guilt?</p>
<p><strong>Millions of lives were at state. Maybe.</strong></p>
<p>The President and other powerful Washington players felt that if the assassination of John F. Kennedy could be tied to a communist conspiracy, either involving Cuba or the Soviet Union, it would inadvertently lead to Word war 3. The assassination happened little over a year following the Cuban Missile Crisis and with schoolchildren still doing the <a href="https://youtu.be/u1MQ4eyg6U4">duck and cover</a> in American classrooms, the scenario might not have been so farfetched.</p>
<p>preconceived conclusions of Oswald as a lone gunman and lie to the American people in order to avoid going to war with the Soviets. Ruby acted alone.</p>
<p>After the <a href="https://youtu.be/7rp3sX3A48g">murder of Lee Harvey Oswald on Live TV</a>, pressure on the White House increased to form a “blue-ribbon commission” to investigate the assassination of John F. Kennedy. </p>
<p>We know a lot about the government’s reaction to the assassination from the <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/pages/LBJ_Phone_Calls.html">White House phone recordings</a> of November 22nd to November 30th.</p>
<p>The morning following the assassination, J. Edgar Hoover called President Johnson and informed him that the CIA had wiretap conversations and photographs of a man pretending to be Oswald at the Soviet embassy in Mexico. The 10:01 am Hoover-Johnson phone call has been erased from the White House Tapes. However the <a href="http://www.history-matters.com/essays/frameup/FourteenMinuteGap/FourteenMinuteGap.htm#_ftnref1">14-minute gap</a> survives in <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=807">transcript form</a>.</p>
<p>Johnson’s White House immediately realized the implications and quickly went into cover-up mode. Johnson would henceforth refer to Oswald’s impostor as the “Mexico Incident”.</p>
<p>On November 25th, <strong>Nicholas Katzenbach</strong>, de facto head of the Justice Department issued <a href="http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/fbi/62-109090/124-10085-10080/html/124-10085-10080_0002a.htm">his infamous memo</a> in which he wrote:</p>
<blockquote class="emphasis"><p>“The public must be satisfied that Oswald was the assassin; that he did not have confederates who are still at large; and that evidence was such that he would have been convicted at trial.”</p></blockquote>
<p>A November 27th <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=861">phone call with Joe Alsop</a>, a CIA media front man with <a href="http://carlbernstein.com/magazine_cia_and_media.php">deep Mockingbird involvement</a> reiterates the need for a blue-ribbon commission capable of satisfying (i.e. fooling) the American public.</p>
<p>The blue -ribbon commission would be headed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Earl Warren lending his reputation, and eventually, his name to the group. </p>
<p>Johnson used his knowledge of the Mexico tapes to play out a doomsday scenario to convince Earl Warren to join the commission. He reminded Warren of the repercussions if Khrushchev or Castro were blamed for the assassination.</p>
<p>On <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=911#relPageId=2&#038;tab=page">November 29th</a> he tells Senator Richard Kuchel:</p>
<blockquote class="emphasis"><p>“Why Khrushchev moved on us… he could kill 39 million in an hour and we could kill 100 million in his country in an hour and… now, I just don’t think you’d want to do that.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Half an hour later he<a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=912"> tells his friend and mentor Senator Richard Russell</a>: </p>
<blockquote class="emphasis"><p>“… we’ve got to take this out of the arena where they’re testifying that Khruschev [sic] and Castro did this and did that and check us into a war that can kill 40 million Americans in an hour&#8230;&#8221; Russell is obviously not pleased with the President conning him into joining the commission.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It is unknown whether or not Russell and Warren knowingly covered up what they honestly believed to be a communist conspiracy.</p>
<p>With a Democrat senator and a Republican senator, two members from the House, also from each party, the Warren Commission was to appear as impartial and bipartisan as possible.</p>
<p>He also named John McCloy of the World Bank, because back then, that was something respectable.</p>
<p>The President also chose disgrace CIA spymaster Allen Dulles to the commission who had recently been fired by Kennedy over the Bay of Pigs fiasco to serve on the commission. It was apparent then, and even more so now where Dulles allegiance lied.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/jfk-conspiracy-warren-commission-members.jpg" alt="jfk-conspiracy-warren-commission-members" width="644" height="360" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14884" /></p>
<p>The seven commissioners were not directly involved with the day-to-day operation of the Warren Commission with the exception of Allen Dulles who was significantly more devoted than the others due to his role at gatekeeper for the CIA. </p>
<p>Gerald Ford was the second most involved member of the commission. He acted as the FBI’s eyes and ears on the commission and routinely leaked information to J. Edgar Hoover.</p>
<p>The commissioners expected to meet a few times and that they would simply rubber stamp an upcoming report being prepared by the FBI.  However when the <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=10402">5-volume report</a> was finally published in December, 1963, the Warren Commission quickly realized that the public was not going to buy any of it. </p>
<p>At the executive session of <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=1327">December 16, 1963</a>  individual commissioners expressed outrage that the report had nothing on the crime itself or on Oswald’s motives.</p>
<p>They hired council <strong>J. Lee Rankin</strong> which in turn hired 16 lawyers. With most members simply lending their names and reputations to the commission, the task of conducting interviews and assembling information from the CIA and the FBI fell to 6 young, low-level, and non-influential researchers.</p>
<p>The commission had no field investigators and had to rely on the secretive CIA, FBI and Secret Service to assist them in field work.</p>
<p>Dulles had knowledge of multiple CIA operations that could have been a motive. He knew of Operation Mongoose, a plan to assassinate Fidel Castro. He was also aware that Castro knew of the plots. He knew of AM/LASH, a CIA cryptonym assigned to a <a href="http://spartacus-educational.com/JFKcubela.htm">senior Cuban official</a> recruited in 1961 to murder Fidel Castro. From the Agency’s point of view, it was possible that the assassination was a blow back from a fail black op.</p>
<p>Allen operated under the CIA mindset of not divulging any information, no matter how relevant. (e.g. The CIA&#8217;s <a href="https://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=49667#relPageId=6">fake defector program</a>) His role was coordinating CIA interviews and even coaching them in advance of appearing before the commission.  </p>
<h3>Ignored, dismissed, distorted, or misrepresented Evidence</h3>
<p>In order to maintain its version of the events of November 22nd in which Oswald and Jack Ruby had both acted completely alone and independently of each other in their actions, the Warren Commission was forced to ignore or downplay evidence which contradicted their story.</p>
<p>To this end they classified, under the guise of national security thousands of files and documents until 2039. A number of these were released from 1995 to 1998 following Oliver Stone’s JFK which resulted in the creation of the Assassination Records Review Board and the passing of the JFK Records Collection Act. </p>
<p><strong>Back and to the left</strong> – The Warren Commission does not mention Kennedy’s violent backward head movement following the final shot. (z313) Despite having seen the Zapruder film, not a single member of the committee described Kennedy’s violent backwards movement.</p>
<p>Theories that CIA was pulling its Mockingbird strings gained legitimacy when Life Magazine went on to buy the rights to the film and chose not to exploit the most precious piece of film in history, but instead, opted to keep it hidden in its vault for the next twelve years.</p>
<p>CBS’s Dan Rather also described the President slumping forward after getting a private viewing of the Zapruder film. A lie.</p>
<p><strong>Gunshot Residue Tests</strong>: Both the NAA Analysis and the spectrographic analysis of the paraffin casts proved that Oswald had not fired a rifle on November 22nd.  The casts and the spectrographic analysis were dismissed as contaminated while the NAA analysis was classified for 17 years for national security reasons.</p>
<p>The <strong>autopsy photographs</strong> and <strong>X-rays</strong> of Kennedy were not used by the Warren Commission. Instead they used cartoons in which they raised the back wound to align better with the throat wound.</p>
<p><strong>Exit vs. Entry Wound</strong> &#8211; In order to dismiss contradicting testimonies made by staff at Parkland Hospital, the Warren Commission claimed that their tests revealed that exit and entry gunshot wounds are indifferentiable from each other. Exit wounds are clearly distinguishable from entry wounds on <a href="http://history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh17/html/WH_Vol17_0436b.htm">their own published goatskin tests</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Ignored any collaboration of Oswald Alibi </strong>&#8211; James Jarman and Harold Norman collaborated Oswald alibi of being in the lunchroom at the time of the murder.</p>
<p><a href="http://spartacus-educational.com/JFKclemons.htm">Acquilla Clemons</a> and Earline Roberts’ testimonies cast doubts on the Warren Commission version of the Tippet murder but the commission chose to go with the changing/unreliable testimony of Helen Markham.</p>
<p><strong>Easy Shots</strong> &#8211; The Warren Commission and the media made a shot from the Texas School Book Depository was an easy shot despite the FBI and Army’s best marksmen unable to duplicate the feat.  </p>
<p><strong>Intact Magic Bullet</strong> &#8211; After the <strong>Edgewood Arsenal Ballistics</strong> tests suggested that the Magic Bullet (CE 399) could not have done what the report says it did without being significantly more damaged, the study was promptly classified for 10 years.</p>
<p><strong>Cherry Picked Testimonies</strong> – The Warren Commission chose Marina Oswald’s version of events that fit in with the official story and ignored her numerous inconsistencies. For example, her claim that she had kept her husband from murdering Richard Nixon but locking <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=1317#relPageId=816">him in the bathroom</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Grassy Knoll Witnesses:</strong> All <a href="http://22november1963.org.uk/jfk-assassination-grassy-knoll-witnesses">witnesses</a> who claimed to have heard shots from the Grassy Knoll were assumed to be mistaken. Their testimonies were misreported or falsified.</p>
<p>Similarly, all witnesses who claimed that the last two shots came in a quick succession were also assumed to be mistaken.</p>
<p><strong>Puff of Smoke</strong> – The seven railroad workers who saw a puff of smoke were also said to have mistaken the steam from a distanced steam pipe for gun smoke.</p>
<p><strong>Secret Service on Grassy Knoll</strong> &#8211; The commission ignored the <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=41#relPageId=545&#038;tab=page">testimony of officer <strong>Joe Marshall Smith</strong></a> who drew his gun on an unidentified man in the parking area behind the picket fence. The man showed Smith his Secret Service badge and Officer Smith let him go. Since the Secret Service was able to account for the location of all its people that day, and none of them were on the Grassy Knoll, the account and collaboratory evidence were dismissed.</p>
<p><strong>Jack Ruby’s Mafia ties </strong> &#8211; The commission waited half a year before interviewing Ruby, ostentatiously, one of the most important witnesses in the case. Ruby had been <a href="http://youtu.be/QKTLeSf4mXY">sentenced to death</a>, but the decision was overturned. in June of ‘64, as the Warren Report was already being drafted, Warren finally flew to Dallas to interview Ruby in his jail cell. </p>
<p>Unfortunately Ruby would barely give out any information claiming that he wasn’t safe and that he should be taking to Washington so that he could testify to the commission.</p>
<blockquote class="emphasis"><p>“I can’t speak here. My life is in danger. Take me to Washington.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Rather, than accommodating Ruby as the Warren Commission had previously done for hundreds of witnesses, Warren simply told him to <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=40#relPageId=206&#038;tab=page">stop talking if he felt that his questions put him in any danger</a>.</p>
<p>In the weeks prior to the assassination, Ruby had called practically every high-level player in Robert Kennedy’s list of American Mafiosos. The Warren Commission dismissed this as Ruby’s attempt to settle a union dispute with his strippers. The Mafia ran a racket where club owners were charged exorbitant union fees for dancers.</p>
<p>The Commission brought in Ruby’s friends and business relations in order to determine whether are not Ruby had any established ties to the “criminal underworld”. Each witness told the commission in turn that Ruby <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=946#relPageId=687&#038;tab=page">was not connected to organized crime</a>. What the Commission failed to note, was that most of Ruby’s friends and partners that they interviewed were themselves active members of organized crime! </p>
<p><strong>They</strong> were the Mafia connection.</p>
<p>The Warren Commission also failed to disclose that Ruby was <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?absPageId=76905">an FBI informant</a> and that the Dallas Police Department had <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=10488#relPageId=92&#038;tab=page">also used him as an informant</a>.</p>
<p>On Jun 9th 1964, Hoover sent Council Rankin a letter stating that Ruby had been and informant for the FBI. When interviewing Hoover, the commission never asked him questions related to Ruby’s FBI connection.</p>
<p>In 1979, the House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded that “<a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=800#relPageId=187">Ruby’s shooting was not a spontaneous act</a>”.</p>
<p><strong>Palm Print on Rifle:</strong> The Warren Commission and the FBI’s <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=59637#relPageId=8">doubts surrounding the providence of Oswald’s palm print</a> on which conveniently tied Oswald to the murder weapon. Nevertheless, it included the evidence in its final report as evidence against Oswald.  </p>
<p><strong>The Dissension of Commissioner Russell</strong> &#8211; Senator Russell, who had been coerced into joining the Warren Commission by President Johnson, grew increasingly displeased with the Warren Commission. At the <a href="http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcexec/wcex1216/html/WcEx1216_0042a.htm">December 16 executive session</a>, Russell made it clear to Allen Dulles that he didn’t trust the CIA.</p>
<p>Russell, Senator John Cooper, and Representative Hale Boggs, refused to endorse the Magic Bullet theory.  Senator Russell took it a step further and he wished for their dissent to be on the record and noted in the Final Report of the Committee. At the Commission’s last meeting, he read his dissent in order to put it on the record. Unfortunately, the final report did not note the three commissioner’s objection to the magic bullet, and Russell’s speech was not in the <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/archive/docsets/1025/index.html">final report</a>, the <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/archive/docsets/1007/index.html">executive sessions records</a>, or the <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/archive/docsets/1006/index.html">26 volumes of hearings and exhibits</a>.</p>
<p>We know of Russell’s dissent thanks to the effort of Harold Weisberg <a href="https://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=4274#relPageId=17">here</a> and <a href="https://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=4275#relPageId=22">here</a>. The episode would cause a permanent break between Senator Russell and President Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. George Burkley Never Interviewed</strong> &#8211; , Kennedy’s personal physician who followed his body to Parkland and then to Bethesda Naval Hospital could have easily addressed the discrepancies between doctors in Texas and Maryland. However, he was never asked to testify. Dr. Burlkey believed he <a href="https://www.maryferrell.org/pages/The_Missing_Physician.html">could give evidence of a conspiracy</a>.</p>
<h3>Destruction of Evidence</h3>
<p>FBI Agent James P. Hosty destroyed his <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=800#relPageId=215&#038;tab=page">pre-assassination files on Oswald</a> as well as a <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/pages/Destruction_of_the_Oswald_Note.html">threatening letter Oswald had left at the Dallas field office</a> in the weeks preceding the assassination.</p>
<p>James Humes, the chief pathologist on Kennedy’s autopsy <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=38#relPageId=380&#038;tab=page">destroyed his notes</a>.</p>
<p>The US Army <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=800#relPageId=254&#038;tab=page">destroyed its file on Oswald</a>.</p>
<p>Allen Dulles even suggested destroying the <a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=1327">meeting records of January 22nd</a>, after the group learned that Oswald had possibly worked as an informant for the FBI.</p>
<p>The Warren Commission Report was delivered to President Johnson on September 24, 1964, with <a href="https://youtu.be/rQCgQsgCyMY">a CBS documentary</a> timed to come out simultaneously.  It was instantly praised by all sectors of the media and generally continued to do so to this day.</p>
<p>The report appeared highly detailed and thoroughly researched. The heavy Warren Report volume was supplemented with 26 volumes of supporting evidence. (see <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gish_Gallop#Argumentum_ad_tl.3Bdr">Argumentum ad tl;dr</a>)</p>
<p>In 1979, the House Select Committee on Assassinations disagreed with the Warren Commission’s conclusion based on (questionable) acoustic evidence and Kennedy’s head movement in the Zapruder film. The committee determined that four shots were fired that day, including one from the Grassy Knoll. They concluded that Kennedy was killed “<a href="http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=800#relPageId=125&#038;tab=page">As a result of conspiracy</a>”.</p>
<p>However, they also concluded that the shot from the Grassy Knoll missed and otherwise generally agreed with the Warren Commission’s version of events, including the Magic Bullet Theory. Nevertheless, the US government currently has <u><strong>two official explanations</strong></u> of the Assassination of John F. Kennedy.</p>

<h1 style="margin: 0px;">President <span style="color: #ff0000;">Eisenhower</span> on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">military-industrial complex</span></h1>
<p><img src="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/conspiracy-quotes-President-Dwight-Eisenhower-Military-Industrial-Complex.jpg" alt="conspiracy-quotes-President-Dwight-Eisenhower-Military-Industrial-Complex" width="644" height="331" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15223" /></p>
<blockquote>
<h5 style="text-transform: none;">“In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.”</h5>
<p style="text-align: right;">~ Dwight D. Eisenhower, <a href="https://youtu.be/knBEQnuJNiI">Farewell to the Nation Speech</a><br />
January 17th, 1961</p>
</blockquote>
<p>President Eisenhower used his last address as POTUS to warn the nation against the rise of the Military-industrial complex, a nation built around the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/mar/02/arms-sales-top-100-producers">arms industry</a> and dependent on perpetual war for survival. Did the nation listen? </p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The same year US President Barack Obama received his Nobel Peace Prize, the United States was responsible for nearly <a href="http://www.globalissues.org/article/75/world-military-spending">half of the world&#8217;s entire military spending</a> of around $1.5 trillion. </p>
<p>Since World War 2, the United States has been in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_United_States_military_operations#1945.E2.80.931949">permanent state of war</a>. </p>
<p><strong>55%</strong> of the entire federal budget for research and development <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/07/us/a-hidden-cost-of-military-cuts-could-be-invention-and-its-industries.html?_r=0">goes to the Pentagon</a>.</p>
<p>To this day, the United States remains the <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/01/24/america_arms_dealer_to_the_world/">world&#8217;s dominant arms dealer</a> and is responsible for around <a href="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/conspiracy-quotes-top-10-arms-exporters-2006-2010.jpg" title="US exports nearly a third of all international arms sales" rel="lightbox">a third of all international arms exports</a>. As such, it has become the <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/03/08/35_countries_the_u_s_has_backed_international_crime_partner/">world’s leading supporter of terror</a>.</p>
<hr class="shortcode hr "  />
<blockquote><p>This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence &#8211; economic, political, even spiritual &#8211; is felt in every city, every statehouse, every office of the federal government. </p>
<p>We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society. <strong>In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military–industrial complex.</strong> The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists, and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals so that security and liberty may prosper together.</p></blockquote>

<h1 style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lord Acton</span> on <span style="color: #ff0000;">Power</span> and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Corruption</span></h1>

<blockquote>
<h5 style="text-transform: none;">“Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.”</h5>
<p style="text-align: right;">~ Lord Acton<br />
April 5th, 1887</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From a letter written by Lord Acton (John Emerich Edward Dalberg) to Archbishop Mandell Creighton on April 5th, 1887. Basically, Dalberg says that all men are corruptible no matter their station or class.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Baron Acton inherited his title from his ancestor and <a href="http://www.illuminatirex.com/members-bavarian-illuminati/">Bavarian Illuminati member</a>, Karl Theodor Dalberg.</p>
<hr class="shortcode hr "  />
<blockquote><p>I cannot accept your canon that we are to judge Pope and King unlike other men, with a favourable presumption that they did no wrong. If there is any presumption it is the other way against holders of power, increasing as the power increases. </p>
<p>Historic responsibility [that is, the later judgment of historians] has to make up for the want of legal responsibility [that is, legal consequences during the rulers&#8217; lifetimes]. <strong>Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.</strong> Great men are almost always bad men, even when they exercise influence and not authority: still more when you superadd the tendency or the certainty of corruption by authority. </p>

<h1 style="margin: 0px;">President <span style="color: #ff0000;">John F. Kennedy</span> on <span style="color: #ff0000;">Secret Societies</span></h1>
<p><img src="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/conspiracy-quotes-JFK-Secret-Societies.jpg" alt="conspiracy-quotes-JFK-Secret-Societies" width="644" height="362" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15217" /></p>
<blockquote>
<h5 style="text-transform: none;">“The very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings.”</h5>
<p style="text-align: right;">~ John F. Kennedy, <a href="http://www.jfklibrary.org/Research/Research-Aids/JFK-Speeches/American-Newspaper-Publishers-Association_19610427.aspx">The President and the Press</a><br />
April 27th, 1961</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The quote from a speech given to the American Newspaper Publishers Association at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York remains a conspiracy theorists&#8217; favorite; especially for those with a penchant for anti-Masonry. Kennedy, undoubtedly, was referring to Freemasonry and the nation&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Masonic_Party">well-known opposition to it</a>. </p>
<p>As a Catholic, Kennedy was <a href="http://www.catholic.com/quickquestions/what-does-the-church-say-about-freemasonry" class="broken_link">forbidden by the Vatican</a> from becoming a Freemason. (This was reaffirmed by the Church as lately as <a href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19831126_declaration-masonic_en.html">1983</a>) He joined the Catholic version of Freemasonry, The <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160301004941/http://www.kofc.org:80/un/en/service/youth/jfk/jfkbio.html">Knights of Columbus</a>.</p>
<p>While claiming a disdain for secrecy, he would later ask in the same speech for journalists to censor themselves and not print everything they knew. Even though no formal war had been declared (they  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war_by_the_United_States#Declarations_of_war">seldom are</a>), he asked them to adopt the <em>&#8220;self-discipline of combat conditions&#8221;</em>. </p>
<p>Why was he asking for this?  He added:</p>
<blockquote>
<h5 style="text-transform: none;">&#8220;For the facts of the matter are that this nation&#8217;s foes have openly boasted of acquiring through our newspapers information they would otherwise hire agents to acquire through theft, bribery or espionage;&#8221;</h5>
</blockquote>
<p>The same open source information <a href="http://www.salon.com/2015/09/26/how_to_explain_the_kgbs_amazing_success_identifying_cia_agents_in_the_field/">ex-KGB Yuri Totrov boasted using</a> to identify deep-cover CIA agent in foreign countries.</p>
<hr class="shortcode hr dark-gray" style="border-width:5px;" />
<h1 style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">V</span> on fearing <span style="color: #ff0000;"><u>your</u> government</span></h1>
<p><img src="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/conspiracy-quotes-v-for-vendetta-people-and-government.jpg" alt="conspiracy-quotes-v-for-vendetta-people-and-government" width="644" height="209" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15225" /></p>
<blockquote>
<h5 style="text-transform: none;">“People shouldn&#8217;t be afraid of their government.  Governments should be afraid of their people.”</h5>
<p style="text-align: right;">~ V, <a href="https://youtu.be/VzjrIk05YyU">V for Vendetta</a> (2006)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spoken by the radical protagonist of the 2006 film, <strong>V for Vendetta</strong>. The script was written by Andy Wachowski and Lana Wachowski of <strong>The Matrix</strong> fame. </p>
<p>The words have been attributed to Alan Moore, writer of the 1980s serialized comic turned <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/140120841X/illuminatirex-20">graphic novel</a>  on which the film is based on. However, the quote does not appear in the book, so don&#8217;t believe everything you read <a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070124002056AAJyv7s">on the Internet</a>. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f624.png" alt="😤" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>The Wachowskis were most likely inspired by the words commonly <a href="http://www.monticello.org/site/jefferson/when-government-fears-people-there-libertyquotation">misattributed to Thomas Jefferson</a>, Samuel Adams, or Thomas Paine.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5 style="text-transform: none;">“When government fears the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.”</h5>
<p style="text-align: right;">~ Author Unknown</p>

<p>The Biblical passage resonates with conspiracy theorists because we see ourselves as truth seekers who are willing to look behind the veil in search of truth and freedom.</p>
<p>However, as <a href="http://www.illuminatirex.com/corporate-government-whistleblowers/">government whistleblowers Ed Snowden and Chelsea Manning</a> can attest to, the truth doesn’t always set you free.</p>

<p>The best thing about this Jackson quote is who it was directed at &#8211; the financiers and politicians behind the latest central banking scam, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Bank_of_the_United_States">Second Bank of the United States</a>. Jackson ran on an anti-banking platform in 1832 and soon used his veto power to kill a bill seeking to renew the bank’s charter.</p>
<p>But the <a href="http://www.illuminatirex.com/illuminati/">elite class</a> is nothing, if not persistent. In 1913, a third central bank was created with the <a href="http://www.illuminatirex.com/new-world-order-banking/">passage of the Federal Reserve Act</a>.</p>
<p>To this day, the Chair of the Federal Reserve Board and the Secretary of the Treasury <a href="http://www.occupy.com/article/year-world-traveling-life-us-treasury-secretary-jack-lew">sit at the very center of world finance</a>. </p>

When you won, you divided the profits amongst you, and when you lost, you charged it to the bank. </p>
<p> You tell me that if I take the deposits from the bank and annul its charter I shall ruin ten thousand families. That may be true, gentlemen, but that is your sin! Should I let you go on, you will ruin fifty thousand families, and that would be my sin! <strong>You are a den of vipers and thieves.

<p>Lee Harvey Oswald, the infamous assassin of President John F. Kennedy, maintained his innocence right until <a href="https://youtu.be/0xU7Lhd7Wwo">being gunned down</a> less than 48 hours following his arrest. There is evidence that Oswald was, in fact, a patsy.  </p>

<p>Governments <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_noir">have always taken advantage of new technologies</a> to spy on both friends and enemies. </p>
<p>However, the spread of Internet usage and rapidly increasing computing power have made the collection of individual data easier than ever before leading to an escalation in domestic spying. Today, virtually all governments of the world participate in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_government_mass_surveillance_projects">mass surveillance programs</a> against their own citizens and other nations. </p>
<p>In 2013, <a href="http://www.illuminatirex.com/corporate-government-whistleblowers/#snowden">whistleblower Edward Snowden</a> gave the world a wakeup call on just how extensive US spying and data collection truly were. That same year, a US mission tasks with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA-247">launching a spy satellite</a> chose the motto <em>&#8220;Nothing Is Beyond Our Reach&#8221;</em> and a logo featuring a <a href="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/conspiracy-quotes-nothing-is-beyond-our-reach.jpg"  title="Nothing Is Beyond Our Reach" rel="lightbox">giant octopus encircling the planet</a> with its tentacles. </p>
<p>The US isn’t the only nation collecting intelligence on everything and everyone; other nations are doing the same within and outside their own borders. China lost face after a Trojan horse <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GhostNet">dubbed GhostNet</a> originating from within its borders was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/03/29/us-security-spying-computers-idUSTRE52R2HQ20090329">discovered on the Dalai Lama’s computers</a>, and eventually, in the systems of dozens of embassies and government offices. </p>
<p>Although most governments aggressively spy on each other, the US dominates the field of cyber espionage and has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet">developed powerful cyber weapons</a>. Despite Snowden&#8217;s revelations of US spying on its partners, the majority of governments are eager to <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/03/whats-next-in-government-surveillance/385667/">enter partnerships with US intelligence agencies</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Membership has its privilege!</strong> </p>
<p>Members of the spying alliance known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">Five Eyes</a> get to play around with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIPRNet">SIPRNet</a>, a US top secret intelligence version of the Internet. </p>
<p>With only a few nations operating their own networks outside US intelligence influence and with unprecedented access to anything and anyone, anywhere at any time, the NSA is indeed much like <strong>a giant octopus encircling the planet</strong>.</p>

Simple substitution cipher used by <a href="http://www.illuminatirex.com/illuminati-novice/">Illuminati Novice</a> and <a href="http://www.illuminatirex.com/illuminati-minerval-secrets/">Minervals.</a> The numbers are from <a href="http://www.dafont.com/ammys-handwriting.font">Ammy&#8217;s Handwriting</a>. </p>
<p>Early 20th century Illuminati researcher René Le Forestier notes in his <em>Les Illumines de Bavière et la Franc-Maçonnerie Allemande</em> that the Bavarian Illuminati used this cipher most frequently because of its simplicity.  (p. 53-54) They were many different versions of the glyph cipher used by Scottish Knights floating around and few members were able to memorize the keys.</p>
<p>The simple cipher was rarely used to write entire documents, but rather to hide the profane names and occupations of members. </p>

<p>Another Illuminati glyph cipher based on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1258111306/illuminatirex-20">A History of Secret Societies</a> by Idris Shah is available for download <a href="http://www.geocities.ws/nu_isis/fonts.html">here</a>. I have no idea if it&#8217;s authentic or not. It varies from the two Scottish Knight ciphers on this page but also has many resemblance. </p>
<p>The Scottish Knight cipher eventually fell into disuse by Illuminati members. The reasons given were that they were too many versions of the cipher floating around and cipher keys had become inconsistent. Members frequently made use of the simple cipher instead, but then usually only to obscure names and places.</p>

Although the base was never itself secret and became widely known in the 80s. its existence was not formally <a href="http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB443/">acknowledges by the US government until mid-2013</a>. Employees of Area 51 usually travel through the base on buses with blacked out windows or fly out of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_(airline)">JANET</a> (<strong><u>J</u></strong>ust <strong><u>A</u></strong>nother <strong><u>N</u></strong>on <strong><u>E</u></strong>xistent <strong><u>T</u></strong>erminal) terminal at Las Vegas&#8217; McCarran International Airport.</p>
<p>The lack of official acknowledgment by the government gave rise to a number of conspiracy theories and the base quickly entered UFO lore when rumors of a downed saucer at Roswell secretly being transported to Area 51.</p>
<p>Here’s what we know: </p>
<h2>A Short History of Area 51</h2>
<p>Between <strong>1951</strong> and <strong>1954</strong>, the area was used by the Atomic Energy Commission to conduct most its nuclear tests. The location is covered in debris due to gunnery practice by bombers at <strong>Nellis Air Force Base</strong>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_14975" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-14975" style="width: 200px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img src="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/government-conspiracies-area-51-u-2-bomber.jpg" alt="U-2 spy plane" width="200" height="122" class="size-full wp-image-14975" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-14975" class="wp-caption-text">U-2 spy plane</figcaption></figure>In <strong>1955</strong>, the CIA  begins <strong>Operation AQUATONE</strong> &#8211; a secret project with the purpose of designing an aircraft that could fly high enough to avoid Soviet surface-to-air missiles and photograph Soviet nuclear and military installations. The CIA and <strong>Skunk Works</strong>, arm manufacturer Lockheed’s elite division begin development on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_U-2">U-2 spy plane</a>.</p>
<p>Several surveyors from Lockheed fly over the area north east of Nellis Air Force base and spot Groom Lake, a dry lakebed surrounded by mountain range and sufficiently away from public area. In may <strong>1955</strong>, the Atomic Energy Commission publicly announces the building of a “<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161222193054/http://roadrunnersinternationale.com/merlin/no_secret_01.jpg">satellite Nevada Test Site installation</a>” via a press release.</p>
<p>That same year, employees from the CIA, the Air Force, and Lockheed begin arriving at the base.  The first U-2 is disassembled in Burbank and secretly transported to Area 51 for testing. The plane is painted with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Advisory_Committee_for_Aeronautics">NACA</a> (NASA’s precursor) markings and operated under the cover of weather-related research. </p>
<p>In 1998, the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/the-cia-and-the-u-2-program-1954-1974/u2.pdf">CIA revealed some details of its U-2 program</a>. and claim it was responsible for numerous UFO sightings of the 50s and 60s.</p>
<p><strong>1957</strong> &#8211; Soviet satellite <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1">Sputnik 1</a> begins orbiting around Earth and capturing shots of US secret installations, including Area 51. Groom Lake employers are aware of the satellite’s trajectory and shelter aircrafts in hangers. However, the Soviets are able to determine the aircraft&#8217;s shape by heat signatures left on the tarmac.</p>
<p>The CIA begins <strong>Operation RAINBOW</strong>&#8211; radar absorbing panels are glued on the outside of the U-2 plane in order to make it invisible to radar. However, the panels increase drag, and its loss of aerodynamics also results into slower speeds and lower altitude.</p>
<p>In <strong>1958</strong>, President Eisenhower signs <a href="http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executive-orders/1958.html">Executive Order No. 10633</a>, establishing restricted airspace over the Groom Lake base.</p>
<p>In <strong>1959</strong>, defense contractor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EG%26G">EG&#038;G</a> moves its radar testing operation to Area 51 and soon begin testing the radar deflecting abilities of <strong>Operation OXCART</strong>, the new Lockheed A-12. EG&#038;G conducts radar tests on mock-ups and concept demonstrators. </p>
<p><strong>Sidenote:</strong> The CIA sets up dummy corporations in order to acquire titanium from the soviets without their knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>1960</strong> &#8211; having successfully tested the U-2, the aircraft goes operational and routinely fly over Soviet territory gathering intelligence. Soviet spies in Turkey have alerted the Soviet authorities of the existence of the U-2, but the Soviets are unable to intercept any. </p>
<p>However, they finally succeed when <a href="https://youtu.be/86ub54ChBc4">Francis Gary Powell’s U-2 is shot down</a> over Soviet territory. Powell is soon embarrassingly paraded on international television, along with the U-2’s remains, and photographs taken of Soviet military bases. Powell returns to the United States in a prisoner exchange 2 years later. </p>
<p><strong>1962</strong> &#8211; the first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_A-12">A-12</a> prototype arrives at Groom Lake.  Unlike the U-2, the A-12 has radar repelling ability built in. The A-12 goes operational in 1965. It leads to the development of the recently operational <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_SR-71_Blackbird">SR-71</a>s.</p>
<p><strong>1968</strong> &#8211; Area 51 receives a captured MIG-21 acquired from an Iraqi defector to Israel.  They begin <strong>Operation HAVE DOUGHNUT</strong>, to assess the MIG’s capabilities. They determine that Soviets aircrafts are not superior to American aircrafts and begin training American pilots against MIGs at Area 51. </p>
<p>They receive two MIG-17s the following year and test them under <strong>Operation HAVE DRILL</strong> and <strong>HAVE FERRY</strong>. Units assigned to the MIGs are known as Red Hats.</p>
<p><strong>1974</strong> &#8211; Skylab astronauts <a href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/531/1">photograph Area 51 from outer space</a> leading to a dispute between the CIA and NASA.</p>
<figure id="attachment_14974" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-14974" style="width: 644px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/government-conspiracies-area-51-skylab-1974.jpg" alt="One of the images taken by NASA in 1974" width="644" height="477" class="size-full wp-image-14974" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-14974" class="wp-caption-text">One of the images taken by NASA in 1974</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>1977</strong> &#8211; Researchers begin testing unusual flat-faceted fuselage crafts in order to make planes invisible to radar. Development of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Have_Blue">Lockheed HAVE BLUE</a> eventually lead to the development of the F-117, the first US-built plane to be completely invisible to radar.</p>
<figure id="attachment_14972" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-14972" style="width: 200px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img src="http://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/government-conspiracies-area-51-F-117-Nighthawk.jpg" alt="F-117 Nighthawk" width="200" height="124" class="size-full wp-image-14972" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-14972" class="wp-caption-text">F-117 Nighthawk</figcaption></figure><strong>1979</strong> &#8211; The CIA relinquishes control of Area 51 to the Air Force. </p>
<p><strong>1981</strong> &#8211; The first YF-117A arrives at Area 51 for its maiden flight. That same year they test the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_F-117_Nighthawk">F-117 Nighthawk</a>.</p>
<p><strong>1982</strong>&#8211; Defense contractor Northrop’s flat-paneled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Tacit_Blue">TACIT BLUE</a> arrives at Area 51 for testing. The plane is able to demonstrate a number of stealth technology concepts. The technology is based on the work of Nazi scientists obtained through <a href="http://www.illuminatirex.com/top-ten-government-conspiracies/#PAPERCLIP">Operation Paperclip</a> who had worked on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horten_Ho_229">Horten Ho 229</a> during World War 2, the world’s first stealth plane. These technologies lead Northrop to the development of the hugely expensive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_B-2_Spirit">B-2 Stealth Bomber</a>.</p>
<p><strong>1989</strong> &#8211; <a href="https://youtu.be/3VWmNm6J09M">Bob Lazar comes forward with claims of having worked at S-4</a>, an underground secret facility located near Area 51. Lazar reported having seen multiple flying saucers and that the US government was reversing alien technology powered by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ununpentium">element 115</a> at Area 51.</p>
<p>Lazar’s claims soon made national news and the location of the test site becomes mainstream knowledge, bringing unwanted attention to stealth technology research conducted at Area 51.</p>
<p><strong>1994</strong> &#8211; Former Area 51 employees file a lawsuit against the Federal government. Employees exposed to toxic fumes from burning crafts and radar absorbing paneling covered in jet fuel in large burn pits are getting sick and dying.  The Air Force considered the radar absorbing materials (RAM) to be highly classified and did not want to risk trucking it outside the base.</p>
<p>President Clinton exempts the base or any other black site  from any environmental liabilities for reasons of ‘national security’ with the signing of Presidential Determination No. 95-48 in 1995.</p>
<p><strong>1995</strong> &#8211; The Federal Government seizes additional land surrounding Area 51, including <a href="http://www.dreamlandresort.com/area51/base.html">White Sides</a> 11 miles (17 km) from the base and <a href="http://www.dreamlandresort.com/area51/area51.htm">Freedom Ridge</a>, 12 miles (19 km) off, then the most popular spots for viewing Area 51. Observers moved on to <a href="http://www.dreamlandresort.com/area51/panorama_0805.html">Tikaboo Peak</a>, 26 miles (41 km) from the base.</p>
<p>If anything, this relatively recent seizure suggests that the base is still very much active.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0269621/">William Fay</a>, executive producer of upcoming Independence Day seeks the military’s assistance for the film. The Pentagon is always keen to help Hollywood with films that portray the US military in a favorable light. However, the Pentagon refuses to help the producers unless they remove all mentions of Area 51 from the film. </p>
<p><strong>1996</strong> &#8211; Following the box office success of Independence Day, Nevada officially designates State Route 375 the <strong>Extraterrestrial Highway</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>2013</strong> &#8211; The <a href="http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB443/">CIA formally acknowledges the existence of Area 51</a> and releases further details on the research done at the base.</p>
<h2>What is Area 51 used for today?</h2>
<p>It is not known what Area 51 is used for today. However, we do know that JANET Boeing 737 regularly take off from Vegas and the Air Force <a href="http://www.dreamlandresort.com/area51/news.html">continues to make improvements</a> to the base and its runways.</p>
<p>It is speculated that the base is mainly used for testing drones and other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVS).</p>
