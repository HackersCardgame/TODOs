href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashid_ad-Din_Sinan>The Old Man of the Mountain</a> who used a potion (hashish) and mind tricks to create and train assassins desperate to obey their master and return to “Paradise”.</p><p>Late medieval Inquisitors authored the <a href=http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/mm/ >Maleus Mafeficarum</a>, or ‘The Hammer for Sorceresses’ in which they codified methods for the interrogation of witches. The book became a bestseller, second only to the Bible. It was the de facto manual for obtaining confessions during the infamous witch trials. As <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/international/24MEMO-GUIDE.html?_r=0">in modern times</a>, the use of torture in interrogations was <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_extirpanda>authorized at the highest level of the Church</a>. Holy Inquisitors were given Absolution (forgiveness) for their acts.</p><p>German physician Franz Mesmer stumbled unto the power of suggestions in the late 18th century with his development of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_magnetism>animal magnetism</a>.  Mesmer travelled throughout France curing aristocrats of their ailments, becoming a phenomenon and irritating the medical establishment. In 1784, King Louis XVI formed a commission made up of this same medical establishment to look into animal magnetism. Predictively, they concluded that there was no evidence for any of Mesmer’s claims. Disgraced, Mesmer left France and was soon (<a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mesmerize">almost</a>) forgotten. However, the commission also issued a second, secret <a href=https://www.rcpe.ac.uk/sites/default/files/files/the_royal_commission_on_animal_-_translated_by_iml_donaldson_1.pdf>‘King’s Eyes Only’ report</a>, warning Louis and his ministers of the dangers of hypnotic seduction.</p><figure id=attachment_17107 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-17107 style="width: 200px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href=https://youtu.be/hiYhMJoGung><img src=https://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/Government-Conspiracy-CIA-MKULTRA-hypnosis-human-plank.jpg alt width=200 height=132 class="size-full wp-image-17107"></a><figcaption id=caption-attachment-17107 class=wp-caption-text>The Human Plank</figcaption></figure>The powers of suggestion would be forgotten for a century until stage hypnotists of the Victorian Age took it up again, achieving fame and riches in the process. They would perform tricks similar to today&#8217;s stage hypnotists, such as the ‘<a href=https://youtu.be/hiYhMJoGung>human plank</a>’. It wouldn’t be long before government agencies took an interest in these techniques for their own purposes.</p><hr class="shortcode hr white" style=border-width:1px;><h2>US Government Interest in Mind Control</h2><p>US interest in mind control can be traced back to the Second World War.  The OSS, the wartime intelligence agency preceding the CIA, formed the Truth Serum Committee, under the Manhattan Project umbrella, to find a drug to aid in interrogations.  George White, who would later become infamous for testing of LSD on unsuspecting citizens in New  York and San Francisco enters the behavior control picture and begins testing different strains of marijuana on himself as well as test subjects.</p><figure id=attachment_17110 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-17110 style="width: 200px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img src=https://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/Government-Conspiracy-CIA-Nuremberg-Trials.jpg alt width=200 height=175 class="size-full wp-image-17110"><figcaption id=caption-attachment-17110 class=wp-caption-text>Nuremberg Trials</figcaption></figure>At the same time Nazi scientist Dr. Kurt Plötner experimented with mescaline on prisoners at Dachau to “eliminate the will of the person examined”, Dr. Winfred Overholser performed similar experiments on unwitting subject at St. Elizabeth Hospital in Washington, DC. Plötner was eventually recruited by US intelligence as part of <a href=https://www.illuminatirex.com/top-ten-government-conspiracies/#PAPERCLIP>Operation Paperclip</a>, a US intelligence program to protect Nazi war criminals from prosecution in return for aiding the United States against the Communists.</p><p>The US government played a major role at the Nuremberg Trials and in the formulation of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Code>Nuremberg Code</a>, a set of ethics and principles for conducting human experimentations. Meanwhile,  its intelligence agencies ignored all ten points in its research. Medical doctors working for the CIA defied their oaths to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primum_non_nocere>do no harm</a>. To avoid public scrutiny, anything dodgy was labeled TOP SECRET, an abuse of National Security that continues to this day.</p><p>The Army Chemical Corps also began research into mind control. They tested potential drugs, such as <a href=https://youtu.be/zLCzR34HfVQ>LSD on American troops</a> and on unwitting US citizens, with tragic circumstances for pro tennis player, <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Blauer>Harold Blauer</a>. Blauer died soon after checking  into the New York Psychiatric Institute seeking treatment for depression following a divorce. He was unaware that the institute had an agreement with the Army Chemical Corps to test drugs on patients as part of the Army’s mind control experiments. Blauer was given five heavy doses of a mescaline derivative (MDA), killing him. The incident led to a subsequent <a href=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/853/124/121222/ >22-year cover-up</a> by the State of New York and the Army.

Can we create by post-H control an action contrary to an individual&#8217;s basic moral principles?</p><p>4. Could we seize a subject and in the space of an hour or two by post-H control have him crash an airplane, wreck a train, etc.? (Short, immediate activity)</p><p>5. Can we by H and SI techniques force a subject (unwilling or otherwise) to travel long distances, commit specified acts and return to us or bring documents or materials? Can a person acting under post-H control successfully travel long distances?</p><p>6.  Can we use SI and H to combat fatigue, produce extreme mental effort?</p><p>7.

Can we design tests to determine whether or not an enemy agent has been conditioned by SI and H or any other method?</p><p>10.   Can we detect SI and H by use of SI and H (regression)?</p><p>11.   Can we make a &#8220;conditioned&#8221; subject reveal by SI and H specifically how they were conditioned (drugs, torture, fatigue, hostage pressure, techniques)?</p><p>12.   Can we devise a system for making unwilling subjects into willing agents and then transfer that control to untrained agency agents in the field by use of codes or identifying signs or credentials?</p><p>13.

How can sodium A or P or any other sleep inducing agent be best concealed in a normal or commonplace item, such as candy, cigarettes, liqueur, wines, coffee, tea, beer, gum water, aspirin tablets, common medicines, coke, tooth paste?</p><p>19.  How effective can the &#8220;carotid artery technique&#8221; be made? Can it be used while subject is unconscious? Is it faster than other techniques?</p><p>20.  Can we, using SI and H extract complicated formula from scientists, engineers, etc., if unwilling? Can we extract details of gun emplacements, landing fields, factories, mines?</p><p>21.  Can we, while a subject is under SI and H control, show them a map and have them point out specific items, locations, etc., on the map? Can we also have them make detailed drawings, sketches, plans?</p><p>Could any of the above be done under field conditions and in a very short space of time?”</p><p style="text-align: right; font-size: 62.5%;">― MORI ID: <a href=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000140401.pdf>140401</a><br> January 1, 1952 (estimated)</p></blockquote><p>During the early years, Allen and his team replicated known hypnosis experiments.

A spontaneous outbreak of insanity rapidly spread through the village and soon affected more than 500 people. One resident jumped out of windows believing himself to be a sparrow or a dragonfly, another ceaselessly tried to remove non existing hair from her mouth to avoid choking. In the end, 7 people died, 50 were interned to psychiatric hospitals, and around 300 villagers experienced hallucinations. A local baker was accused of using inferior rye flour causing the mass poisoning.</p><p>The following month a group of experts arrived from Switzerland to investigate the source of the outbreak. The group included Dr. Albert Hofmann of Sandoz Chemical, the first man to synthesize LSD in his laboratory years earlier. They determined that a grain ergot (a fungus) present in the regionally-obtained flour had been the culprit for the outbreak. Little did anyone know at the time, the group of biochemists were closely tied to the CIA, who had been testing Sandoz-supplied LSD and other drugs on unwitting subjects as part of their behavior modification research. Sandoz knew that the bread it had been testing for weeks was contaminated, not with grain ergot, but with a “<a href=http://www.voltairenet.org/article164447.html class=broken_link>diethylamide-like compound</a>”.</p><p>In 2009, researcher and author Hank Albarelli received a reply to a Freedom of Information request he had made a decade earlier.

CIA doctors researched non-violent methods such as hypnosis, but also used electroshocks, sleep deprivation and other forms of torture… ANYTHING to achieve their goals.</p><p>Aware of the stigma associated with working with clandestine agencies, the CIA used a variety of fronts to or cut out to keep itself insulated from researchers. The Agency used cut outs, intermediaries between researchers and the Agency to hide its role. The two major cut outs used by the CIA were the Geishecker Foundation for Medical Research and the Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology. (The latter created though subprojects 48 and 60)</p><p>Through these fronts, the CIA forged partnerships with prominent professors and researchers at American universities. Some had TOP SECRET clearance and the full knowledge of working for US intelligence, while other researchers were unwitting, unaware of the identity of their benefactors. Thus, the CIA developed relationships with over 80 institutions, including prestigious universities, hospitals and pharmaceutical manufacturers.</p><p>A great number of subprojects were dedicated to the procurement of drugs and chemicals. Others dealt with the development and testing of drugs and chemical, while another group concentrated on non-chemical mind control techniques such as hypnosis and sleep deprivation. Some subprojects dealt with the program&#8217;s logistics, such as renting or building testing facilities.</p><p>The majority of subprojects were of direct interest to the Agency and had a reasonable expectancy of having a use in field operations. Others were meant to forge relationships with a persons of interest to the CIA. They could be called upon at when needed at a later time. Others were simply financed to give the cutouts legitimacy as research institutions.</p><p>The CIA financed a wide range of experiments.  Subproject 119 sought to remotely control the human mind. Researcher in Subproject 136 was a study of extrasensory perception (ESP) to evaluate its use in intelligence gathering. Subproject 121 funded research into African witch doctors. Subproject 143 financed the development of a bacteria for the sabotage of petroleum products. In 1967, the CIA successfully contaminated a Cuba-bound oil shipment causing widespread engine failures and breakdowns.</p><figure id=attachment_17080 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-17080 style="width: 170px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img src=https://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/government-conspiracies-MKULTRA-Subproject-4-Mulhollands-Manual-1.jpg alt width=170 height=271 class="size-full wp-image-17080"><figcaption id=caption-attachment-17080 class=wp-caption-text>Mulholland&#8217;s Manual</figcaption></figure>Subprojects 4, 15, and 19 funded magician John Mulholland’s writing of a TOP SECRET magician’s manual for spycraft use.

One patient remembers one of these messages: “You killed your mother.” (He hadn’t.) The patients were periodically awakened with a massive doses of amphetamine and a series of electroshocks, up to 40 times stronger than what is considered safe for humans.</p><p>Linda McDonald was one of Cameron’s unfortunate patient. Diagnosed as an acute schizophrenic, she was taken to the Sleep Room where she slept for 86 consecutive days while enduring 109 shock treatments and megadoses of amphetamines. Cameron considered her cured and a great success! However McDonald was unable to complete basic tasks on her own and had to be toilet trained. She had no memory of her husband and children.</p><p>She and a group of former Cameron patients sued the US government. The <a href=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/06/world/cia-near-settlement-of-lawsuit-by-subjects-of-mind-control-tests.html>CIA settled the suit out of court</a> with 9 of the plaintiffs for a total of $750K. (The events were dramatized in a 1998 2-part mini-series, <a href=https://youtu.be/7g_Vzd_l9Gg>The Sleep Room</a>.) McDonald herself was ineligible for the settlement since the CIA had ceased payment to Cameron at the time of her treatment.  In a twist, the suit uncovered that the Canadian government had funded Cameron’s research. McDonald and approximately 80 other victims were offered a <a href=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/19/world/canada-will-pay-50-s-test-victims.html>settlement of $80k each</a> by the government of Canada.</p><p>Without a single patient “cured”, Dr. Ewen Cameron’s treatments soon became part of the <a href=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB122/CIA%20Kubark%201-60.pdf>KUBARK Torture Manuel</a>.</p><h2>Project MKSEARCH</h2><p>Following the Bay of Pigs fiasco, John F. Kennedy fired Allen Dulles and appointed John McCone as Director of the CIA. McCone’s created a new directorate dedicated to scientific research. He transferred most of MKULTRA’s subprojects under the new directorate&#8217;s Office of Research and Development (ORD). Thanks to his mentor, Richard Helms, Gottlieb’s is promoted to the number 2 position of the entire Technical Service Division which is expected to continue the operational aspects of MKULTRA.</p><p>Gottlieb carefully cherry picks from the 149 MKULTRA subprojects and on June 7th, 1964, moves some of them into 7 individual subprojects under the new cryptonym of MKSEARCH. MKULTRA itself is <a href=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0005444836.pdf>phased out from 1964 to 1967</a>.</p><p><strong>MKSEARCH Subproject 1 (MKULTRA 62)</strong><br> TESTING &#8211; Dr. Maitland Baldwin at the National Institutes of Health was a brain surgeon who had worked with the Agency since its ARTICHOKE days. The CIA was aware that Baldwin was completely nuts but admired his zeal and ideas. He performed lobotomies on apes before placing them in his DIY isolation chamber. (which the CIA flipped the bill for after a freaked out soldier damaged it escaping) He’d remove heads from moneys and place it on another&#8230;that kind of nuttiness.</p><p><strong>MKSEARCH Subproject 2 (MKULTRA 78, 110)</strong><br> PROCUREMENT &#8211; Continuance of a $150k a year contract with Bacteriological and Pharmaceutical Consults, a private laboratory ran by an ex-CIA scientist. The lab could deliver microorganisms quickly and served as backchannel for the procurement of bioweapons without the knowledge of their usual source, the Army’s laboratories at Fort Detrick.</p><p><strong>MKSEARCH Subproject 3 (MKULTRA 124, 140)</strong><br> TESTING &#8211; This source of testing became especially important to Gottlieb following the closure of the safehouse program. Dr. James Hamilton p<a href=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000196947.pdf>rovided payed guinea pigs interned at Vacaville State Prison</a> in California. Between 1967 and 1968, Hamilton experimented on an estimated 400 to 1000 prisoners.</p><p><strong>MKSEARCH Subproject 4 (MKULTRA 3, 14, 16, 43)</strong><br> TESTING &#8211; Gottlieb wished to continue the safehouse program despite the <a href=https://archive.org/details/DOC_0000017748>CIA’s Inspector General recommendation</a> to shut it down.  The testing of drugs on unwitting johns continued unembedded for a few years with the Agency paying out $30k in 1964 to keep the safehouses running. In February 1965, George White spent $1,100 on prostitutes alone.  Under pressure, Gottlieb was forced to end the program and the San Francisco safehouses closed later that year, with the New York safehouse ceasing operations the next year.</p><p><strong>MKSEARCH Subproject 5 (MKULTRA 116, 146)</strong><br> PROCUREMENT &#8211; This project provided Gottlieb with a backchannel for chemical which were difficult to acquire. The source was an unnamed industrialist with his fingers in multiple concerns, including a chemical company. He was a great source of information and able to manufacture and provide the CIA with chemical weapons without alerting anyone outside TSS.</p><p><strong>MKSEARCH Subproject 6  (MKULTRA 23, 25, 26)</strong><br> TESTING &#038; COVER &#8211; Dr. Charles Geschickter continued to provide his Geschickter Fund for the Medical Research as a cover for CIA-sponsored research.  Through this conduit, the Agency continued to fund expeditions into South America for new potential drugs. Geschickter himself gathered data on and experimented on terminally-ill Cancer patients at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington.</p><p><strong>MKSEARCH Subproject 7  (MKULTRA 9, 26, 28, 47)</strong><br> TESTING &#8211; Dr. Pfeiffer provided another source of testing and provided the Agency with the properties of drugs it was interested in. Carl Pfeiffer tested drugs for the CIA at the University of Illinois, Emory University and the United States Penitentiary in Atlanta, as well as the Neuropsychiatric Institute and the Bordentown Reformatory in New Jersey.</p><p>PROJECT MKSEARCH continues until June 1972 when Gottlieb becomes increasingly occupied with his duties after being appointed as new head of TSD by his mentor and newly-appointed Director of the CIA, Richard Helms.</p><h2>The End of MKULTRA</h2><figure id=attachment_17113 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-17113 style="width: 168px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img src=https://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/Government-Conspiracy-CIA-Richard-Helms.jpg alt width=168 height=151 class="size-full wp-image-17113"><figcaption id=caption-attachment-17113 class=wp-caption-text>Richard Helms</figcaption></figure>On the heels of Watergate and in his last days as CIA director, Richard Helm gave the order to destroy all documents and tapes relating to MKULTRA. This was unusual, even by Agency standards, as internal regulations prohibited wholesale destructions of records. On January 31, 1973, Gottlieb dutifully passed on Helm’s instructions to <a href=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0005444812.pdf>destroy all records pertaining to MKULTRA</a> and experiments in human behavior modifications. As justification, Gottlieb testified it was due to a “<a href=https://archive.org/stream/CiaCongressionalHearingsOnHumanDrugTesting/CiaCongressionalHearingsOnSecretChemicalsAndDrugs#page/n185/mode/1up>burgeoning paper problem</a>” while Helms claimed it was to protect professional reputations (Their own, no doubt.) if the public was to hear of the program.</p><p>Helm’s instincts were correct. On May 9th, 1973, his replacement as director of the CIA <a href=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB222/schlesinger_jewels.pdf>James Schlesinger issues a memorandum</a> to all CIA employees to submit records of all operations they believed to be outside the Agency&#8217;s charter. The collected reports become known as the <a href=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB222/index.htm>Family Jewels</a>, a ticking time bomb containing many of the CIA’s dirtiest secrets. The file includes a <a href=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB222/top04.pdf>memo to CIA director William Colby</a> suggesting he deny having any knowledge the existence of MKULTRA. It also makes <a href=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB222/top07.pdf>references to Yuli Nosenko</a>, a Soviet defector who was subjected to ARTICHOKE interrogation techniques for 16 months while being kept in cramped 10&#8217;x 10&#8242; cell.</p><figure id=attachment_17095 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-17095 style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img src=https://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/Government-Conspiracy-CIA-hersh-New-York-Time-Operation-CHAOS.jpg alt width=300 height=238 class="size-full wp-image-17095"><figcaption id=caption-attachment-17095 class=wp-caption-text>New York Times, Dec. 22, 1974</figcaption></figure>Sure enough, contents of the dossier leaked to the press and Seymour Hersh at the <a href=http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/238963/huge-c-i-a-operation-reported-in-u-s-against.pdf>New York Times promptly blows the lid on Operation CHAOS</a>, a huge domestic spying program to keep tabs on hundreds of thousands of US citizens from 1967 to 1974. In response to the public outcry, President Gerald Ford appointed the Rockefeller Commission while Congress formed the Church Committee to investigate illegal activities of the CIA.</p><p>Fearful of what such an investigation into MKULTRA might uncover, the CIA waste no time as General Counsel Lawrence Houston immediately travels to Washington to brief Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld, then part of the Ford administration, on Operation Dormouse.</p><div class="shortcode clearfix box   "><h2>OPERATION DORMOUSE</h2><p>Operation Dormouse, as Houston explained, was the Agency’s plan to give the investigators and the media a tasty morsel to chew on in the form of MKULTRA in order to keep revelations of Project ARTICHOKE from reaching the light of day, which in Houston’s opinion, would undo the Central Intelligence Agency.</p><p>They agreed to throw Dr. Sidney Gottlieb to the wolves (<a href=https://archive.org/stream/CiaCongressionalHearingsOnHumanDrugTesting/CiaCongressionalHearingsOnSecretChemicalsAndDrugs#page/n163/mode/1up>Gottlieb was appalled that his name had not been blacked out</a> in FOIA releases) as well as to reveal ties to Harvard, Yale, Cornell and other prestigious universities and hospitals. This would insure that the universities and the media themselves would act as gatekeepers and justify the CIA excesses and experiments on US citizens.</p><p>The plan worked.</p><p>The Pandora’s box that was ARTICHOKE remained closed. The public remained focus on  MKULTRA LSD experiments and prostitutes, despite ARTICHOKE operation continuing in parallel with mind control experiments <a href=http://truth-out.org/archive/component/k2/item/89725:cries-from-the-past-tortures-ugly-echoes>for 17 years</a>.</p></div><p>Due to the wholesale destruction of MKULTRA files the Rockefeller Commission and the Church Committee were forced to rely on a surviving copy of the <a href=https://archive.org/details/DOC_0000017748>1963 Inspector General’s report</a> and the not-so-reliable testimonies of former CIA officers and participant in the MKULTRA program.</p><p>Gottlieb testified to the Church Committee under the name Victor Scheider but couldn’t recall much information and appeared unfamiliar with the projects he was supervising. Interviews of career officers by the Church Committee and the Rockefeller Commission proved largely unhelpful until two years later, when a cache of 7 boxes containing invoices and other MKULTRA financial records <a href=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/history/e1950/mkultra/Hearing02.htm>were uncovered at a Retired Records Center</a> outside of Washington.</p><p>Gottlieb was called back to Washington to testify in 1977. This time he <a href=https://archive.org/stream/CiaCongressionalHearingsOnHumanDrugTesting/CiaCongressionalHearingsOnSecretChemicalsAndDrugs#page/n159/mode/2up>testified under his own name</a> but under condition of immunity. Despite this, the former spook’s testimony was not useful due to what Senator Kennedy described as Gottlieb&#8217;s “<a href=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/history/e1950/mkultra/Hearing05.htm>fuzzy memory about this whole area</a>”.</p><figure id=attachment_17123 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-17123 style="width: 168px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img src=https://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/Government-Conspiracy-CIA-Robert-Lashbrook.jpg alt width=168 height=184 class="size-full wp-image-17123"><figcaption id=caption-attachment-17123 class=wp-caption-text>Robert Lashbrook</figcaption></figure>Gottlieb’s number two man, Richard Lashbrook was equally unhelpful going so far as to commit perjury. He testified to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1977/09/05/the-diaries-of-a-cia-operative/65b08a3e-c95a-434e-b1c6-c05f726a3a6f/?utm_term=.16665d5daef8">having no firsthand knowledge of the safe house program</a> (subproject 3) despite being listed as the operation’s supervisor. Furthermore, <a href=https://archive.org/stream/CiaCongressionalHearingsOnHumanDrugTesting/CiaCongressionalHearingsOnSecretChemicalsAndDrugs#page/n100/mode/1up>George White’s diaries</a> revealed that Lashbrook had personally visited the 81 Bedford Street safehouse in Greenwich Village on June 8th and September 16th, 1953.</p><p>Lashbrook also revealed that the documents obtained by the committee might be “boilerplate” and not necessarily indicative of the projects’ true purpose. He explained that the CIA used <a href=https://archive.org/stream/CiaCongressionalHearingsOnHumanDrugTesting/CiaCongressionalHearingsOnSecretChemicalsAndDrugs#page/n101/mode/2up>a cover file system</a>, with one set of files containing actual information and another containing boilerplate content only.</p><p>In addition to the destruction of evidence and the perjured testimony of witnesses, the investigators themselves were also intent on keeping some parts of the project hidden from the public. Nelson Rockefeller, chairman of the Presidential commission <a href=http://stevenwarran-backstage.blogspot.com/2013/08/why-rockefeller-tried-to-cover-up-cia.html>worked behind the scenes to sabotage his own investigation</a> into illegal CIA activities. Rockefeller was compromised having himself signed off on MKULTRA experiments in federal hospitals while Under Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare in the early 50s.</p><h2>LEGACY</h2><p>The CIA and their media pundits continue to circulate claims that projects ARTICHOKE and MKULTRA were failure that resulted in nothing of any use to the US intelligence.  Gottlieb himself concluded shortly before his death that “<a href=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/10/us/sidney-gottlieb-80-dies-took-lsd-to-cia.html>The experiments were useless&#8230;</a>”.</p><figure id=attachment_17122 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-17122 style="width: 168px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img src=https://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/Government-Conspiracy-CIA-Miles-Copeland.jpg alt width=168 height=182 class="size-full wp-image-17122"><figcaption id=caption-attachment-17122 class=wp-caption-text>“You wouldn’t believe what those weirdos come up with! The congressional subcommittee which went into this sort of thing got only the barest glimpse.”<br>― Miles Copeland<br></figcaption></figure>This is inconsistent with the Agency’s own records, some of which I’ve quoted and linked above that demonstrate that aspects of the program were successful and applied in interrogations and other field operations.  It is unlikely that the CIA would have dedicated so many resources for over two decades conducting useless experiments. Additionally, Gottlieb receives the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinguished_Intelligence_Medal>Distinguished Intelligence Medal</a>, given for “outstanding services or for achievement of a distinctly exceptional nature in a duty or responsibility”. Again, not the sort of thing given out for 20+ years of consistent failures.</p><p>CIA Director Admiral Stansfield Turner’s statement that the Agency was <a href=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/history/e1950/mkultra/Hearing02.htm>no longer involved in behavior modification research</a> is also contradicted by the sheer amount of research accumulated on the subject. The CIA’s Office of Research and Development did not stay idle following taking over the duties of MKULTRA.  Author John Marks whose earlier FOIA request uncovered the 7 missing boxes in 1977 refiled a similar request for the Office of Research and Development and received a response that 130 boxes of document were available.</p><p>To this day, the CIA and other intelligence agencies continue to experiment with drugs and methods that will give them an edge in interrogations. Whistleblower Victor Marchetti confirmed in 1977 that the programs were continuing.</p><div class="shortcode clearfix box   "><h2>What is Project MONARCH?</h2><p>Distrust for the CIA and the desire to fill the gaps left behind by Agency lies and cover-ups have giving rise to a questionable theories surrounding its mind control projects.</p><p>Researchers into MKULTRA and other government mind control programs are bound to run into claims of “Monarch” mind control programming.
