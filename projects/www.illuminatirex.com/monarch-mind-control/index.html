Monarchs carry out their assignments and consequently have no memory of their actions. According to some estimates, there are over 2 million Americans currently under mind control.</p><p>Monarch slaves are taken as infants and are traumatized using electroshocks, drugs, sexual abuse, mind games, and hypnosis in order to force the mind to split and create an alternative personality to deal with the pain. <strong>The victim imagines that someone else is being tortured and the mind is forced to split.</strong> Each personality (or <strong>alter</strong>, as in ‘<u><strong>alter</strong></u>nate personality’ ) is then programmed and trained to perform specific tasks and missions.</p><p>One alter can be a deadly assassin, trained in martial arts, explosives, and weaponry. While another, an innocent looking courier carrying clandestine messages between world leaders, mob bosses, puppet dictators, and Hollywood insiders. Alters perform their assignments without the knowledge of the host’s main or front personality.  The traumas create amnesia walls between the different personalities, meaning that each alter is totally unaware of the existence of the others.</p><p>Although, accounts vary on the exact methods used, the common key ingredient is trauma. Lots of it.</p><p>Monarchs can have hundreds of different alters coexisting inside them. Programmers insert codes and signals which are used by controllers to call up different personalities and give command. For example, <em>“Mission Completed DIA-5018”</em> will cause the slave to go into a deep sleep. ❗<strong>Note</strong>: If you fall asleep immediately reading this phrase, you might be a mind-control slave.</p><h2>Greek Letter Programs</h2><p>Major program levels are often named after Greek letters but these can be unique to each programmer or for each individual mind-controlled slave.</p><p><strong>ALPHA</strong> &#8211; General Programming &#8211; This is the first programming put in. It includes giving slaves a photographic memory that record everything every alters see or hear.</p><p><strong>BETA</strong> &#8211; Sexual Programming &#8211; These alters are instructed in the art of seduction and sexual pleasure. Betas take part in ritual sex, acting and directing child pornography, and prostitution.  Those trained as sex kittens often see themselves as cats</p><p>Top BETAS are known as <strong>Presidential Models</strong>; as the title implies, they discretely service Presidents, Royalty, and other high-ranking government officials. They regularly hang around the White House.</p><p><strong>DELTA</strong> &#8211; Assassination Programming &#8211; Alters trained in combat, assassination, and espionage.</p><p><strong>THETA</strong> &#8211; Psychic Killer Programming &#8211; Psychic assassins able to cause aneurysms from anywhere. Anytime. They telepathically communicate with “Mother”.</p><p><strong>GAMMA</strong> &#8211; Deception Programming &#8211; These alters are trained as deceivers. They spread disinformation and are able to throw a therapist off track.</p><p><strong>OMEGA</strong> &#8211; Suicide Programming &#8211; Alters programmed for self-mutilation and self-destruction.</p><p>Children of Monarch slaves, emitting from multi-generational families, are known as <strong>Bloodliners</strong>.  They are considered superior to <strong>Non-Bloodliners</strong>, who are often kidnapped off the street or purchased from underground child trafficking rings. Non-bloodliners are deemed expandable  and are often sacrificed in blood rituals or unceremoniously murdered to terrify and further traumatized bloodliners.</p><h2>Walt Disney and Hollywood Mind Control</h2><p><img src=https://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/what-is-monarch-mind-control-Walt-Disney-210x210.jpg alt=what-is-monarch-mind-control-walt-disney width=210 height=210 class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-16449">Disney, the man, the studio, and the theme parks are often cited by Monarch victims as an essential part of the government’s mind control program. Programmers use electroshock in combination with Fantasia’s imagery to induce dissociative personalities and for programming. Program runners realized that bringing in people from all over the world to military facilities would eventually give rise to suspicions, so they worked with Walt Disney in designing his theme parks to include facilities for mind control programming. Many of the rides are designed for use in mind control and to traumatize young children.</p><p>MGM’s Wizard of Oz and Disney’s Alice in Wonderland are favorites of Monarch programmers. Victims are told to go “over the rainbow”, or “there’s no place like home” to reach a safe place in Wizard of Oz programming or “go through the looking-glass” if using Alice in Wonderland.  “Follow the yellow Brick Road.” or “Follow the White Rabbit” are triggers to follow the programmer’s commands.</p><p>Illuminati programmers designed Star Wars for use in trauma-base mind control programming.</p><p>Monarch programming is also used on the masses via movies, televisions, and music. They are used to desensitize the public or to trigger programs in mind-controlled slaves.

At the same time Nazi scientist Dr. Kurt Plötner experimented with mescaline on prisoners at Dachau to “eliminate the will of the person examined”, Dr. Winfred Overholser performed similar experiments on unwitting subject at St. Elizabeth Hospital in Washington, DC. Plötner was eventually recruited by US intelligence as part of <a href=https://www.illuminatirex.com/top-ten-government-conspiracies/#PAPERCLIP>Operation Paperclip</a>, a post-war program to recruit valuable Nazi scientists and identify and useful research.</p><figure id=attachment_16450 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-16450 style="width: 197px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img src=https://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/what-is-monarch-mind-control-Sidney-Gottlieb.jpg alt="“The experiments were useless.” ~Sidney Gottlieb, Head of MKULTRA 1953-1973" width=197 height=236 class="size-full wp-image-16450"><figcaption id=caption-attachment-16450 class=wp-caption-text><em>“The experiments were useless.”</em> ~Sidney Gottlieb, Head of MKULTRA 1953-1973</figcaption></figure>Following the outbreak of World War 2, Navy intelligence and the Army Chemical Corps began developing methods of mind control. The CIA’s predecessor, the OSS experimented with different strains of marijuana to develop an effective truth serum. In 1947, Naval Intelligence launched Project CHATTER to study the efficiency of various drugs in interrogations.</p><p>The CIA entered the mind control game in 1950 with the <a href=http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/mkultra/MKULTRA1/DOC_0000144900/DOC_0000144900.pdf>creation of Project BLUEBIRD</a> (MORI ID: <a href=http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/mkultra/MKULTRA1/DOC_0000144900/DOC_0000144900.pdf>144900</a>) with former Naval intelligence officer Morse Allan heading the program. Initially, the program <a href=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000140401.pdf>researched hypnosis and sleep induction</a> for use in extracting information from foreign agents as well as safeguarding information from the enemy employing similar techniques.

This is not science fiction. This has and is being done. I have done it.”</em></p><p>In 1971, Estabrooks once again praised the merits of hypnosis in Science Digest in which he claimed to have successfully used hypnotic couriers in clandestine operations as first described in his 1954 CIA proposal.</p><blockquote><p>“The &#8220;hypnotic courier,&#8221; on the other hand, provides a unique solution. I was involved in preparing many subjects for this work during World War II. One successful case involved an Army Service Corps Captain whom we&#8217;ll call George Smith.</p><p>Captain Smith had undergone months of training. He was an excellent subject but did not realize it. I had removed from him, by post-hypnotic suggestion, all recollection of ever having been hypnotized.</p><p>First I had the Service Corps call the captain to Washington and tell him they needed a report of the mechanical equipment of Division X headquartered in Tokyo. Smith was ordered to leave by jet next morning, pick up the report and return at once. Consciously, that was all he knew, and it was the story he gave to his wife and friends.</p><p>Then I put him under deep hypnosis, and gave him &#8212; orally &#8212; a vital message to be delivered directly on his arrival in Japan to a certain colonel &#8212; let&#8217;s say his name was Brown &#8212; of military intelligence. Outside of myself, Colonel Brown was the only person who could hypnotize Captain Smith. This is &#8220;locking.&#8221; I performed it by saying to the hypnotized Captain: &#8220;Until further orders from me, only Colonel Brown and I can hypnotize you. We will use a signal phrase &#8216;the moon is clear.&#8217; Whenever you hear this phrase from Brown or myself you will pass instantly into deep hypnosis.&#8221; When Captain Smith re-awakened, he had no conscious memory or what happened in trance. All that he was aware of was that he must head for Tokyo to pick up a division report.</p><p>On arrival there, Smith reported to Brown, who hypnotized him with the signal phrase. Under hypnosis, Smith delivered my message and received one to bring back. Awakened, he was given the division report and returned home by jet. There I hypnotized him once more with the signal phrase, and he spieled off Brown&#8217;s answer that had been dutifully tucked away in his unconscious mind.</p><p>The system is virtually foolproof. As exemplified by this case, the information was &#8220;locked&#8221; in Smith&#8217;s unconscious for retrieval by the only two people who knew the combination. The subject had no conscious memory of what happened, so could not spill the beans. No one else could hypnotize him even if they might know the signal phrase.”</p><p style="text-align: right;">― <a href=http://www.mindspring.com/~txporter/scidig.htm>Hypnosis Comes of Age</a>, Science Digest, 1971</p></blockquote><div class="shortcode clearfix box   "><h2>The Strange Case of Candy Jones: Hypnotic Courier, Spy, Assassin, Cover Model</h2><figure id=attachment_16455 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-16455 style="width: 197px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img src=https://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/what-is-monarch-mind-control-candy-jones.jpg alt="Can Jones, Pin-up Girl/CIA Assassin" width=197 height=265 class="size-full wp-image-16455"><figcaption id=caption-attachment-16455 class=wp-caption-text>Can Jones, Pin-up Girl/CIA Assassin</figcaption></figure><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy_Jones>Candy Jones</a> was a successful New York model in the 1940s and 50s and a leading pin-up girl during World War 2.

His lecture, entitled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FUersarZuo">Hypnosis in MPD: Ritual Abuse</a>, popularly known as “The Greenbaum Speech” described the epidemic of ritual abuse sweeping the United States.  Hammond has a solid reputation as a psychotherapist and hypnosis expert and hundreds of therapists attended the conference.</p><figure id=attachment_16474 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-16474 style="width: 197px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img src=https://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/what-is-monarch-mind-control-Corydon-Hammond.jpg alt="Corydon Hammond" width=197 height=183 class="size-full wp-image-16474"><figcaption id=caption-attachment-16474 class=wp-caption-text>Corydon Hammond</figcaption></figure>This is the same claim he had <a href="https://youtu.be/EcWbuBPNtPw?t=1h18m08s">made on Geraldo years earlier</a>, except he added a twist… not only was ritual abuse real, it was used by a secretive worldwide network of Satanists intent on building a robotic army of Manchurian Candidates who did assassinations, prostitution, child porn, snuff films, drug smuggling, as well as international arm dealing in order to create a Satanic order ruling the world.</p><p>Of note for readers of this article, Hammond specifically mentions Project MONARCH which he described as a US government intelligence black program. The speech marks the earliest documented reference to Monarch. He also mentioned <a href="https://youtu.be/9FUersarZuo?t=1h21m6s">the Illuminati</a>.</p><p>Hammond received this information two and half year before giving his speech. He has confirmed much of it though consultation with his clients. Although Hammond doesn’t name his source, <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/ >conspiratards</a> Cathy O’Brien and Mark Phillips were beginning to speak out and distributing “proof” of their experience around this time, (More on the dynamic duo below) making them likely candidates as his sources.</p><p>Hammond publicized many of the elements that would later become staples of Monarch mind control survivor testimonies.</p><p>He talked on how infants are taken at around two and half year old and are made dissociative through sexual and physical torture. Five years later, the abuse is kicked up a notch until the end of their teenage years and reinforced periodically on adults. ‘Bloodliners’, children coming multiple generations of ritual abuse, are precious to the program.</p><p>Code words and secret signals are used to activate personalities.  Delta codes to activate an assassin; Beta codes for sex.</p><figure id=attachment_16476 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-16476 style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img src=https://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/what-is-monarch-mind-control-zoolander.jpg alt="Zoolander, 2001 Paramount Picutres" width=250 height=125 class="size-full wp-image-16476"><figcaption id=caption-attachment-16476 class=wp-caption-text>Zoolander, 2001 Paramount Picutres</figcaption></figure>He laid out the different levels of programming, including the Greek letter programs listed above. He also revealed how to access different programs, and more importantly for therapists in the room, he detailed how to deprogram mind control victims.  He determined that between half to two thirds of ritually abused patients had some sort of mind control programming. Thus linking Satanic ritual abuse with the government’s mind control research.</p><p>Hammond named Dr. Green (aka Greene or Greenbaum) as one of the key players in the government’s mind control program. Green was raised in Germany as a Hasidic Jew and taken to a concentration camp once the Nazis took power. The Nazi scientists took a liking to him and he began helping them in experiments.  He came over to work in the US with other Nazi scientists under Paperclip and studied medicine on Uncle Sam’s dime. His experience made him a valuable mind control researcher and he designed and supervised many of the programs.</p><p>Dr. Green’s backstory would change dramatically in the future.</p><p>The professor’s lecture was very well received, ending with a standing ovation. One of the therapists attending the conference was New Orleans therapist <strong>Valerie Wolf</strong>. Although, she herself didn’t attend Hammond’s lecture, she soon heard about it from a colleague who had, and immediately got an audio recording of the lecture.</p><h2>Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments</h2><p>Back home, Valerie Wolf discovered that two of her ritually abused victims had also been subjected to mind-control using Hammond’s techniques.

She learned espionage tradecraft, including how to pick locks, “being secretive”,  and memory techniques enabling her to develop a photographic memory.

She would often escape and sneak into his office photographically memorizing entire files, <a href="http://whale.to/b/sp/springmeier.html#Program Codes During 1972-1976 for Dr. Green">including trigger codewords</a>, CIA and military correspondence, as well as project names (cryptonyms) and subproject numbers.</p><p>After nearly a decade, DeNicola proved a poor subject matter for assassination training, Dr. Green attempted to trigger her self-destruct programming.</p><figure id=attachment_16479 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-16479 style="width: 200px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img src=https://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/what-is-monarch-mind-control-Claudia-Mullen.jpg alt="Claudia Mullen" width=200 height=150 class="size-full wp-image-16479"><figcaption id=caption-attachment-16479 class=wp-caption-text>Claudia Mullen</figcaption></figure>The <a href="https://youtu.be/GCdAsuxzf5c?t=12m9s">second victim to testify, <strong>Claudia Mullen</strong></a>, was mind-controlled for almost three decades from 1957 to 1984. As a result, she offers a lot more insider knowledge of the program than DeNicola. Mullen was used a child and all through in her teens in sexual entrapment schemes to blackmail powerful politicians. The CIA had figured out that video footage of anyone having sex with an underage child was the surest method to get anyone to do what the Agency wanted.</p><p>Mullen testified to being subjected to radiation, hypnosis, electroshocks, sleep deprivation, isolation, brainwashing, as well as physical and sexual abuse in order to create multiple personalities and make her into a perfect spy. Mullen eventually developed over 100 individual personalities, mostly girls aged 1 to 16.</p><p>At the age of 8, she was recruited by the CIA and met Sidney Gottlieb, who she knew as Uncle Syd. She received training at the Agency’s Deep Creek Cabins in Maryland on sexually pleasing and coaxing information out of older men before being used in a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Midnight_Climax>Project Midnight Climax</a>-type honey pot operations to extract information or blackmail powerful and influential people, be it friend or foe. The CIA wished to maintained a continuous source of funding for its mind control experiments.</p><p>In addition to Gottlieb, Mullen personally met pretty much anyone connected to the CIA’s MKULTRA program; Richard Helms, Allan Dulles, John Gittinger, Ewan Cameron, George White, Morse Allen, and Martin Horne. This is a veritable who’s who of the government’s research into mind control. Her therapist claimed that Mullen couldn’t have known this level of details without actually being there or filing FOIA request herself, which Mullen hadn’t.</p><figure id=attachment_16478 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-16478 style="width: 200px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img src=https://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/what-is-monarch-mind-control-John-Marks-search-manchurian-candidate.jpg alt="It&#039;s in the book." width=200 height=309 class="size-full wp-image-16478"><figcaption id=caption-attachment-16478 class=wp-caption-text>It&#8217;s in the book.

She was subjected to trauma while still in her mother&#8217;s womb and became a subject of the CIA’s Project MONARCH who in addition to the usual spy/courier/prostitute training wished to turn her into one of three Mothers of Darkness, women destined to become brides of Lucifer. 😯</p><p>Like O’Brien, Cisco was abused by her own father who was also her handler and programmer from 1947 well into the 60s. Her father, known as Dr. Black, worked directly under the previously mentioned Dr. Green who was Cisco’s primary programmer. She identifies Dr. Green as none other than <strong>Josef Mengele</strong>, the Angel of Death himself. Mengele, an Illuminati Grand Master was the project’s <a href=http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/mindcontrol/chapter01.htm>lead programmer and original designer</a>. He would say things like “<a href=https://archive.org/stream/Volume1TheyKnowNotWhatTheyDo_201604/Volume%201-%20They%20Know%20Not%20What%20They%20Do#page/n31/mode/2up class=broken_link>Dance marionette, dance!</a>” (I kid you not 🙄 )</p><p>They used trauma as well as films such as Fantasia, Alice in Wonderland, and Wizard of Oz to split her mind into individual programmable alters. Sometimes, demons would take human form and perform the programming. The demons themselves were also inserted into victims to protect the programming. Scary stuff. 😕</p><p>She has Beta (sex kitten) and Delta (assassin) espionage alters which she used to blackmail people into submission to the Illuminati. She was sexually servicing US President as far back as Dwight Eisenhower and did missions for the Kennedys but was never herself a Presidential Model. She was a master programmer and remember instructing Mark Phillips. 😯 Illuminati-wise, she was aligned with the British Royals faction. All Monarchs receive end-time programming which is set to trigger when the Antichrist arrives.</p><p>Her programming began breaking down following the death of her father. Once again, another self-proclaimed mind control expert, Fritz Springmeier, was willing to neglect his family to undertake the deprogramming of Wheeler.</p><p>They wrote 3 books together. <a href=https://archive.org/details/Volume1TheyKnowNotWhatTheyDo_201604 class=broken_link>They Know Not What They Do, An Illustrated Guide to Monarch Programming-Mind Control</a> in 1995, <a href=https://archive.org/details/Volume2_201604 class=broken_link>The Illuminati Formula Used to Create an Undetectable Total Mind Controlled Slave</a> in 1996 and <a href=https://archive.org/details/pdfy-r4h3bvzSoE3Ln9Y7>Deeper Insights into the Illuminati Formula</a> in 1997.

She was a Presidential Model sex slave, spy, as well as a courier between world leaders.</p><p>Taylor was sexually and physically abused soon after her birth by her father and grandfather in a shack located behind the family home. She began doing child porn at the age of 2 and participated in torturous rituals and sexual orgies. Her father used Wizard of Oz and Disney films to program her. She would forget everything when she heard “There’s no place like home.” She was also used to kidnap other children who were lured into black cars then used in porn or rituals and killed off.</p><p>At the age of 5, her father took her to a slave auction where she was sold to comedian Bob Hope. She received high-level Beta programming at US military bases and NASA and trained as a Presidential Model. Taylor sexualy serviced every US president from John Kennedy to Bill Clinton as well as government officials, foreign dignitaries, world leaders, mobsters, and Hollywood celebrities. She would wear a blue butterfly pin or earrings to signal insiders.</p><p>She was impregnated twice a year and the fetuses were used in sacrificial ceremonies. Like O’Brien, she named her daughter Kelly. This was done so that pedophile George HW Bush could easier to remember the names of his ”Bush Babies”.</p><p>She carried messages for the Council, an Illuminati-like cabal in control of the entire planet, and was made privy to their future plans. She was flown by helicopter to ships, hotels, and private islands to deliver messages. An excellent swimmer, she sometimes had to use her “dolphin programming” to swim out to yachts waiting in international waters, the preferred meeting place for Council members.</p><p>Henry Kissinger used her photographic memory as a mind file. He could add any information he wished and retrieve it whenever he desired.

She initially thought she had been sexually abused in rituals but in 1986, realized that she had been part of the government’s Top Secret Project MONARCH, a CIA white slavery operation connected to MKULTRA. Sensing danger for her family she left them in April of 1991 and fled to Hawaii. Fortunately, she did not flee into the arms of an self-proclaimed deprogramming expert, but began deprogramming herself. She wrote her first book, <a href=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0006F6HEW/illuminatirex-20 class=broken_link>Starshine: One woman&#8217;s valiant escape from mind control: a novel</a>, a fictionalized account of her life.</p><p>She lived with Cathy O’Brien and Mark Phillips for a year and half, but the relationship <a href=http://educate-yourself.org/mc/markphillipstruestory12jul00.shtml>ended on a sour note</a> after Phillips told her she had never been a victim of mind control and had imagined the whole thing. In 1999, she published <a href=https://archive.org/details/BriceTaylorThanksForTheMemoriesWITHPICTURESLARGEFONT class=broken_link>Thanks for the Memories</a>, in which she tells her experience as a government mind control sex slave and human filing cabinet.</p><p>Like other MONARCH survivors, she routinely mingled with Hollywood celebrities. Frank Sinatra confided in her that he had ordered the hit on Elvis. Sylvester Stallone loved dolphin porn and directed Taylor and her daughter Kelly performing underwater ballet while having sex with dolphins and sea turtles. She reports that the sea turtles weren&#8217;t into it.</p><p>Taylor felt nauseous after recalling a one week affair with Prince Charles.</p><h2>Other Monarchs</h2><p>Other alleged MONARCH mind control victim have come forward. Most notably, <strong>Arizona Wilder</strong>, in a 1999 David Icke interview entitled <a href=https://youtu.be/p62cTYszOFg>Revelations of a Mother Goddess</a>. She was subjected to programming and forced to participate in rituals where she summoned and channeled interdimensional Reptilian aliens for the Illuminati. She started recovering her memories after the death of Josef Mengele in 1979, who she also identifies as Dr. Green or Dr. Greenbaum.</p><p>Arizona Wilder (Jennifer Ann Kealey) gained a lot of exposure following her Icke interview and I have listed her as one the <a href=https://www.illuminatirex.com/illuminati-whistleblowers/#wilder>top 10 Illuminati whistleblowers</a>.</p><p>Victoria Vulpes is another alleged victim interviewed by Walter Bowart in <a href=https://archive.org/details/OperationMindControlResearchersEdition>Operation Mind Control</a>. Like others, she was involved in an incestuous relationship with her father and forced to participate in Satanic rituals where she witnessed blood sacrifices of infants. She claims that she was <a href=https://archive.org/stream/OperationMindControlResearchersEdition/Operation%20Mind%20Control%20-%20Researcher%27s%20Edition#page/n205/mode/2up>inoculated against for HIV in 1968</a>. This is a verifiable claim which an immunologist could use to rid the world of AIDS.  But, no. 🙁</p><p>Another victim, Kathleen Sullivan wrote <a href=https://archive.org/details/2003SullivanUnshackledASurvivorsStoryOfMindControl class=broken_link>Unshackled</a>, detailing her experience as a survivor of Monarch mind control. Sullivan has <a href=https://youtu.be/_eGyjZ1sGW0>appeared in some interviews</a> alongside Brice Taylor. She is no friend of Phillips or O’Brien either. She is interviewed <a href=http://members.tranquility.net/~rwinkel/CKLN/HTML2/transc17.htm>here</a>.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>There is no doubt that the US government used drugs, radiation, sleep deprivation, electroshocks, and other forms of torture on unsuspecting Americans.</p><p>There is no doubt that the women outlined in this article have actually suffered abuse in the past.</p><p>There is no doubt that the victims themselves believe to be telling the truth. However, their stories improbabilities and exaggerations make them unlikely to be true. At least, not how they’ve described them.  Regardless, <strong>be it intentional disinformation or unintentional misinformation</strong>, they are most likely doing disservice to actual victims of mind control.</p><p>Therapist Valerie Wolf point that scenarios such as Satanic rituals could have been deliberately used by Dr. Green, Dr. Orne, and other CIA doctors as <a href=http://members.tranquility.net/~rwinkel/CKLN/HTML/transc11.htm>covers for their experiments</a> bears a second mention as it would explain a lot of inconsistencies in survivor testimonies. The same has been <a href=http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_mindcon04.htm>theorized about UFO abductions</a>. The elaborate charades would serve two purposes.</p><p>Firstly, it would make the victim appear crazy to almost anyone they confess to.</p><p>Secondly, it would waste a lot of a therapist’s time and help dissimulate signs of being mind controlled if the victim ever remembered and sought out therapy.</p><p>Would the government commit atrocities attributed to government-sponsored ritual abuse? <strong>Yes</strong>.</p><p>Would the government torture children and used them as poisoned honey pots in blackmail operations? Possibly, especially when governments consider it a necessity to maintaining their power.</p><figure id=attachment_16456 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-16456 style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href=https://youtu.be/8AOfbnGkuGc><img src=https://www.illuminatirex.com/wp-content/uploads/what-is-monarch-mind-control-hypnotoad.jpg alt="CIA hypnotists have nothing on Hypnotoad" width=300 height=169 class="size-full wp-image-16456"></a><figcaption id=caption-attachment-16456 class=wp-caption-text><strong>Click image at your own peril</strong></figcaption></figure><h3 class="collapseomatic " id="id5e46f24842601"  tabindex="0" title="Main Sources and Further Information:"    >Main Sources and Further Information:</h3><div id=target-id5e46f24842601 class="collapseomatic_content "> MONARCH<br> <a href=http://www.rigorousintuition.ca/board2/index.php>Rigorous Intuition</a> &#8211; Mind Control and Ritual Abuse Forum</p><p><a href=https://wikispooks.com/w/images/0/0a/Project_Monarch.pdf>Project Monarch: Nazi Mind Control</a><br> by Ron Patton<br> *The article soon became a classic following its appearance in Patton&#8217;s <a href=http://www.paranoiamagazine.com/ >Paranoia Magazine</a> in the Fall of 1996.
